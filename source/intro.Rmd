## Overview

This chapter provides an introduction to data science and the R programming language.
The goal here is to get your hands dirty right from the start! We will walk through an entire data analysis,
and along the way introduce different types of data analysis question, some fundamental programming
concepts in R, and the basics of loading, cleaning, and visualizing data. In the following chapters, we will
dig into each of these steps in much more detail; but for now, let's jump in to see how much we can do
with data science!

## Chapter learning objectives

By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to do the following:

- Identify the different types of data analysis question and categorize a question into the correct type.
- Load the `tidyverse` package into R.
- Read tabular data with `read_csv`.
- Create new variables and objects in R using the assignment symbol.
- Create and organize subsets of tabular data using `filter`, `select`, `arrange`, and `slice`.
- Add and modify columns in tabular data using `mutate`.
- Visualize data with a `ggplot` bar plot.
- Use `?` to access help and documentation tools in R.

## Canadian languages data set

In this chapter, \index{Canadian languages} we will walk through a full analysis of a data set relating to
languages spoken at home by Canadian residents (Figure \@ref(fig:canada-map)). Many Indigenous peoples exist in Canada
with their own cultures and languages; these languages are often unique to Canada and not spoken
anywhere else in the world [@statcan2018mothertongue]. Sadly, colonization has
led to the loss of many of these languages. For instance, generations of
children were not allowed to speak their mother tongue (the first language an
individual learns in childhood) in Canadian residential schools. Colonizers
also renamed places they had "discovered" [@wilson2018].  Acts such as these
have significantly harmed the continuity of Indigenous languages in Canada, and
some languages are considered "endangered" as few people report speaking them.
To learn more, please see *Canadian Geographic*'s article, "Mapping Indigenous Languages in
Canada" [@walker2017],
*They Came for the Children: Canada, Aboriginal
peoples, and Residential Schools* [@children2012]
and the *Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's*
*Calls to Action* [@calls2015].

```

The data set we will study in this chapter is taken from
[the `canlang` R data package](https://ttimbers.github.io/canlang/)
[@timbers2020canlang], which has
population language data collected during the 2016 Canadian census [@cancensus2016].
In this data, there are 214 languages recorded, each having six different properties:

1. `category`: Higher-level language category, describing whether the language is an Official Canadian language, an Aboriginal (i.e., Indigenous) language, or a Non-Official and Non-Aboriginal language.
2. `language`: The name of the language.
3. `mother_tongue`: Number of Canadian residents who reported the language as their mother tongue. Mother tongue is generally defined as the language someone was exposed to since birth.
4. `most_at_home`: Number of Canadian residents who reported the language as being spoken most often at home.
5. `most_at_work`: Number of Canadian residents who reported the language as being used most often at work.
6. `lang_known`: Number of Canadian residents who reported knowledge of the language.

According to the census, more than 60 Aboriginal languages were reported
as being spoken in Canada. Suppose we want to know which are the most common;
then we might ask the following question, which we wish to answer using our data:

*Which ten Aboriginal languages were most often reported in 2016 as mother
tongues in Canada, and how many people speak each of them?*

## Asking a question

Every good data analysis begins with a *question*&mdash;like the
above&mdash;that you aim to answer using data. As it turns out, there
are actually a number of different *types* of question regarding data:
descriptive, exploratory, inferential, predictive, causal, and mechanistic,
all of which are defined in Table \@ref(tab:questions-table).
Carefully formulating a question as early as possible in your analysis&mdash;and
correctly identifying which type of question it is&mdash;will guide your overall approach to
the analysis as well as the selection of appropriate tools.\index{question!data analysis}
\index{descriptive question!definition}
\index{exploratory question!definition}
\index{predictive question!definition}
\index{inferential question!definition}
\index{causal question!definition}
\index{mechanistic question!definition}

Table: (\#tab:questions-table) Types of data analysis question [@leek2015question; @peng2015art].

|Question type|    Description         |     Example        |
|-------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Descriptive | A question that asks about summarized characteristics of a data set without interpretation (i.e., report a fact). | How many people live in each province and territory in Canada? |
| Exploratory | A question that asks if there are patterns, trends, or relationships within a single data set. Often used to propose hypotheses for future study. | Does political party voting change with indicators of wealth in a set of data collected on 2,000 people living in Canada? |
| Predictive | A question that asks about predicting measurements or labels for individuals (people or things). The focus is on what things predict some outcome, but not what causes the outcome. | What political party will someone vote for in the next Canadian election? |
| Inferential | A question that looks for patterns, trends, or relationships in a single data set **and** also asks for quantification of how applicable these findings are to the wider population. | Does political party voting change with indicators of wealth for all people living in Canada? |
| Causal | A question that asks about whether changing one factor will lead to a change in another factor, on average, in the wider population. | Does wealth lead to voting for a certain political party in Canadian elections? |
| Mechanistic | A question that asks about the underlying mechanism of the observed patterns, trends, or relationships (i.e., how does it happen?) | How does wealth lead to voting for a certain political party in Canadian elections? |

In this book, you will learn techniques to answer the
first four types of question: descriptive, exploratory, predictive, and inferential;
causal and mechanistic questions are beyond the scope of this book.
In particular, you will learn how to apply the following analysis tools:

1. **Summarization:** \index{summarization!overview} computing and reporting aggregated values pertaining to a data set.
Summarization is most often used to answer descriptive questions,
and can occasionally help with answering exploratory questions.
For example, you might use summarization to answer the following question:
*What is the average race time for runners in this data set?*
Tools for summarization are covered in detail in Chapters \@ref(reading)
and \@ref(wrangling), but appear regularly throughout the text.
2. **Visualization:** \index{visualization!overview} plotting data graphically.
Visualization is typically used to answer descriptive and exploratory questions,
but plays a critical supporting role in answering all of the types of question in Table \@ref(tab:questions-table).
For example, you might use visualization to answer the following question:
*Is there any relationship between race time and age for runners in this data set?*
This is covered in detail in Chapter \@ref(viz), but again appears regularly throughout the book.
3. **Classification:** \index{classification!overview} predicting a class or category for a new observation.
Classification is used to answer predictive questions.
For example, you might use classification to answer the following question:
*Given measurements of a tumor's average cell area and perimeter, is the tumor benign or malignant?*
Classification is covered in Chapters \@ref(classification1) and \@ref(classification2).
4. **Regression:**  \index{regression!overview} predicting a quantitative value for a new observation.
Regression is also used to answer predictive questions.
For example, you might use regression to answer the following question:
*What will be the race time for a 20-year-old runner who weighs 50kg?*
Regression is covered in Chapters \@ref(regression1) and \@ref(regression2).
5. **Clustering:** \index{clustering!overview} finding previously unknown/unlabeled subgroups in a
data set. Clustering is often used to answer exploratory questions.
For example, you might use clustering to answer the following question:
*What products are commonly bought together on Amazon?*
Clustering is covered in Chapter \@ref(clustering).
6. **Estimation:**  \index{estimation!overview} taking measurements for a small number of items from a large group
 and making a good guess for the average or proportion for the large group. Estimation
is used to answer inferential questions.
For example, you might use estimation to answer the following question:
*Given a survey of cellphone ownership of 100 Canadians, what proportion
of the entire Canadian population own Android phones?*
Estimation is covered in Chapter \@ref(inference).

Referring to Table \@ref(tab:questions-table), our question about
Aboriginal languages is an example of a *descriptive question*: we are
summarizing the characteristics of a data set without further interpretation.
And referring to the list above, it looks like we should use visualization
and perhaps some summarization to answer the question. So in the remainder
of this chapter, we will work towards making a visualization that shows
us the ten most common Aboriginal languages in Canada and their associated counts,
according to the 2016 census.

## Loading a tabular data set
A data set is, at its core essence, a structured collection of numbers and characters.
Aside from that, there are really no strict rules; data sets can come in
many different forms! Perhaps the most common form of data set that you will
find in the wild, however, is *tabular data*\index{tabular data}. Think spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel: tabular data are
rectangular-shaped and spreadsheet-like, as shown in Figure
\@ref(fig:img-spreadsheet-vs-dataframe). In this book, we will focus primarily on tabular data.

Since we are using R for data analysis in this book, the first step for us is to
load the data into R. When we load tabular data into
R, it is represented as a *data frame* object\index{data frame!overview}. Figure
\@ref(fig:img-spreadsheet-vs-dataframe) shows that an R data frame is very similar
to a spreadsheet. We refer to the rows as \index{observation} **observations**; these are the things that we
collect the data on, e.g., voters, cities, etc. We refer to the columns as \index{variable}
**variables**; these are the characteristics of those observations, e.g., voters' political
affiliations, cities' populations, etc.

```{r img-spreadsheet-vs-dataframe, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "A spreadsheet versus a data frame in R.", out.width="100%", fig.retina = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/intro/spreadsheet_vs_dataframe.png")
```

The first kind of data file that we will learn how to load into R as a data
frame is the *comma-separated values* format (`.csv` for short)\index{comma-separated values|see{csv}}\index{csv}.  These files
have names ending in `.csv`, and can be opened and saved using common
spreadsheet programs like Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets.  For example, the
`.csv` file named `can_lang.csv`
is included with [the code for this book](https://github.com/UBC-DSCI/introduction-to-datascience/tree/master/data).
If we were to open this data in a plain text editor (a program like Notepad that just shows
text with no formatting), we would see each row on its own line, and each entry in the table separated by a comma:

```code
category,language,mother_tongue,most_at_home,most_at_work,lang_known
Aboriginal languages,"Aboriginal languages, n.o.s.",590,235,30,665
Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages,Afrikaans,10260,4785,85,23415
Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages,"Afro-Asiatic languages, n.i.e.",1150,44
Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages,Akan (Twi),13460,5985,25,22150
Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages,Albanian,26895,13135,345,31930
Aboriginal languages,"Algonquian languages, n.i.e.",45,10,0,120
Aboriginal languages,Algonquin,1260,370,40,2480
Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages,American Sign Language,2685,3020,1145,21
Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages,Amharic,22465,12785,200,33670
```

To load this data into R so that we can do things with it (e.g., perform
analyses or create data visualizations), we will need to use a *function.* \index{function} A
function is a special word in R that takes instructions (we call these
*arguments*) \index{argument} and does something. The function we will use to load a `.csv` file
into R is called `read_csv`. \index{read function!read\_csv} In its most basic
use-case, `read_csv` expects that the data file:

- has column names (or *headers*),
- uses a comma (`,`) to separate the columns, and
- does not have row names.


Below you'll see the code used to load the data into R using the `read_csv`
function. Note that the `read_csv` function is not included in the base
installation of R, meaning that it is not one of the primary functions ready to
use when you install R. Therefore, you need to load it from somewhere else
before you can use it. The place from which we will load it is called an R *package*.
An R package \index{package} is a collection of functions that can be used in addition to the
built-in R package functions once loaded. The `read_csv` function, in
particular, can be made accessible by loading
[the `tidyverse` R package](https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/) [@tidyverse; @wickham2019tidverse]
using the `library` function. \index{library} The `tidyverse` \index{tidyverse} package contains many
functions that we will use throughout this book to load, clean, wrangle,
and visualize data.

```{r load-tidyverse, message = TRUE, warning = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

> **Note:** You may have noticed that we got some extra
> output from R saying `Attaching packages` and `Conflicts` below our code
> line. These are examples of *messages* in R, which give the user more
> information that might be handy to know. The `Attaching packages` message is
> natural when loading `tidyverse`, since `tidyverse` actually automatically
> causes other packages to be imported too, such as `dplyr`.  In the future,
> when we load `tidyverse` in this book, we will silence these messages to help
> with the readability of the book.  The `Conflicts` message is also totally normal
> in this circumstance.  This message tells you if functions from different
> packages share the same name, which is confusing to R.  For example, in this
> case, the `dplyr` package and the `stats` package both provide a function
> called `filter`. The message above (`dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()`)
> is R telling you that it is going to default to the `dplyr` package version
> of this function. So if you use the `filter` function, you will be using the
> `dplyr` version. In order to use the `stats` version, you need to use its
> full name `stats::filter`.  Messages are not errors, so generally you don't
> need to take action when you see a message; but you should always read the message
> and critically think about what it means and whether you need to do anything
> about it.

After loading the `tidyverse` package, we can call the `read_csv` function and
pass it a single argument: the name of the file, `"can_lang.csv"`. We have to
put quotes around file names and other letters and words that we use in our
code to distinguish it from the special words (like functions!) that make up the R programming
language.  The file's name is the only argument we need to provide because our
file satisfies everything else that the `read_csv` function expects in the default
use-case. Figure \@ref(fig:img-read-csv) describes how we use the `read_csv`
to read data into R.

(ref:img-read-csv) Syntax for the `read_csv` function.

``` {r img-read-csv, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "(ref:img-read-csv)", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%", fig.pos = "H", out.extra=""}
image_read("img/intro/read_csv_function.png") |>
  image_crop("1625x1900")
```

```{r load-can-lang-data, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
read_csv("data/can_lang.csv")
```

> **Note:** There is another function
> that also loads csv files named `read.csv`. We will *always* use
> `read_csv` in this book, as it is designed to play nicely with all of the
> other `tidyverse` functions, which we will use extensively. Be
> careful not to accidentally use `read.csv`, as it can cause some tricky
> errors to occur in your code that are hard to track down!

## Naming things in R

When we loaded the 2016 Canadian census language data
using `read_csv`, we did not give this data frame a name.
Therefore the data was just printed on the screen,
and we cannot do anything else with it. That isn't very useful.
What would be more useful would be to give a name
to the data frame that `read_csv` outputs,
so that we can refer to it later for analysis and visualization.

The way to assign a name to a value in R is via the *assignment symbol* `<-`.
\index{aaaassignsymb@\texttt{<-}|see{assignment symbol}}\index{assignment symbol}
On the left side of the assignment symbol you put the name that you want
to use, and on the right side of the assignment symbol
you put the value that you want the name to refer to.
Names can be used to refer to almost anything in R, such as numbers,
words (also known as *strings* of characters), and data frames!
Below, we set `my_number` to `3` (the result of `1+2`)
and we set `name` to the string `"Alice"`. \index{string}

```{r naming-things}
my_number <- 1 + 2
name <- "Alice"
```
Note that when
we name something in R using the assignment symbol, `<-`,
we do not need to surround the name we are creating  with quotes. This is
because we are formally telling R that this special word denotes
the value of whatever is on the right-hand side.
Only characters and words that act as *values* on the right-hand side of the assignment
symbol&mdash;e.g., the file name `"data/can_lang.csv"` that we specified before, or `"Alice"` above&mdash;need
to be surrounded by quotes.

After making the assignment, we can use the special name words we have created in
place of their values. For example, if we want to do something with the value `3` later on,
we can just use `my_number` instead. Let's try adding 2 to `my_number`; you will see that
R just interprets this as adding 3 and 2:
```{r naming-things2}
my_number + 2
```

Object names \index{object} can consist of letters, numbers, periods `.` and underscores `_`.
Other symbols won't work since they have their own meanings in R. For example,
`-` is the subtraction symbol; if we try to assign a name with
the `-` symbol, R will complain and we will get an error!

```{r, eval = F}
my-number <- 1
```
```
Error in my - number <- 1 : object 'my' not found
```

There are certain conventions for naming objects in R.
When naming \index{object!naming convention} an object we
suggest using only lowercase letters, numbers and underscores `_` to separate
the words in a name.  R is case sensitive, which means that `Letter` and
`letter` would be two different objects in R.  You should also try to give your
objects meaningful names.  For instance, you *can* name a data frame `x`.
However, using more meaningful terms, such as `language_data`, will help you
remember what each name in your code represents.  We recommend following the
Tidyverse naming conventions outlined in the *Tidyverse Style Guide* [@tidyversestyleguide].  Let's
now use the assignment symbol to give the name
`can_lang` to the 2016 Canadian census language data frame that we get from
`read_csv`.

```{r load-data-with-name, message=FALSE}
can_lang <- read_csv("data/can_lang.csv")
```

Wait a minute, nothing happened this time! Where's our data?
Actually, something did happen: the data was loaded in
and now has the name `can_lang` associated with it.
And we can use that name to access the data frame and do things with it.
For example, we can type the name of the data frame to print the first few rows
on the screen. You will also see at the top that the number of observations (i.e., rows) and
variables (i.e., columns) are printed. Printing the first few rows of a data frame
like this is a handy way to get a quick sense for what is contained in a data frame.

```{r print}
can_lang
```

## Creating subsets of data frames with `filter` & `select`

Now that we've loaded our data into R, we can start wrangling the data to
find the ten Aboriginal languages that were most often reported
in 2016 as mother tongues in Canada. In particular, we will construct
a table with the ten Aboriginal languages that have the largest
counts in the `mother_tongue` column.
The `filter` and `select` functions from the `tidyverse` package will help us
here. The `filter` \index{filter} function allows you to obtain a subset of the
rows with specific values, while the `select` \index{select} function allows you
to obtain a subset of the columns. Therefore, we can `filter` the rows to extract the
Aboriginal languages in the data set, and then use `select` to obtain only the
columns we want to include in our table.

### Using `filter` to extract rows
Looking at the `can_lang` data above, we see the `category` column contains different
high-level categories of languages, which include "Aboriginal languages",
"Non-Official & Non-Aboriginal languages" and "Official languages".  To answer
our question we want to filter our data set so we restrict our attention
to only those languages in the "Aboriginal languages" category.

We can use the `filter` \index{filter} function to obtain the subset of rows with desired
values from a data frame. Figure \@ref(fig:img-filter) outlines what arguments we need to specify to use `filter`. The first argument to `filter` is the name of the data frame
object, `can_lang`. The second argument is a *logical statement* \index{logical statement} to use when
filtering the rows. A logical statement evaluates to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`;
`filter` keeps only those rows for which the logical statement evaluates to `TRUE`.
For example, in our analysis, we are interested in keeping only languages in the
"Aboriginal languages" higher-level category. We can use
the *equivalency operator* `==` \index{logical operator!equivalency} to compare the values
of the `category` column with the value `"Aboriginal languages"`; you will learn about
many other kinds of logical statements in Chapter \@ref(wrangling).  Similar to
when we loaded the data file and put quotes around the file name, here we need
to put quotes around `"Aboriginal languages"`. Using quotes tells R that this
is a string *value* \index{string} and not one of the special words that make up the R
programming language, or one of the names we have given to data frames in the
code we have already written.

(ref:img-filter) Syntax for the `filter` function.

```{r img-filter, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "(ref:img-filter)", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/intro/filter_function.png") |>
  image_crop("1625x1900")
```

With these arguments, `filter` returns a data frame that has all the columns of
the input data frame, but only those rows we asked for in our logical filter
statement.

```{r}
aboriginal_lang <- filter(can_lang, category == "Aboriginal languages")
aboriginal_lang
```
It's good practice to check the output after using a
function in R. We can see the original `can_lang` data set contained 214 rows
with multiple kinds of `category`. The data frame
`aboriginal_lang` contains only 67 rows, and looks like it only contains languages in
the "Aboriginal languages" in the `category` column. So it looks like the function
gave us the result we wanted!

### Using `select` to extract columns

Now let's use `select` \index{select} to extract the `language` and `mother_tongue` columns
from this data frame. Figure \@ref(fig:img-select) shows us the syntax for the `select` function. To extract these columns, we need to provide the `select`
function with three arguments. The first argument is the name of the data frame
object, which in this example is `aboriginal_lang`. The second and third
arguments are the column names that we want to select: `language` and
`mother_tongue`. After passing these three arguments, the  `select` function
returns two columns (the `language` and `mother_tongue` columns that we asked
for) as a data frame. This code is also a great example of why being
able to name things in R is useful: you can see that we are using the
result of our earlier `filter` step (which we named `aboriginal_lang`) here
in the next step of the analysis!

(ref:img-select) Syntax for the `select` function.

``` {r img-select, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "(ref:img-select)", out.width="100%", fig.retina = 2}
image_read("img/intro/select_function.png") |>
  image_crop("1625x1900")
```


```{r}
selected_lang <- select(aboriginal_lang, language, mother_tongue)
selected_lang
```

## Using `arrange` to order and `slice` to select rows by index number

We have used `filter` and `select` to obtain a table with only the Aboriginal
languages in the data set and their associated counts. However, we want to know
the **ten** languages that are spoken most often. As a next step, we will
order the `mother_tongue` column from largest to smallest value and then extract only
the top ten rows. This is where the `arrange` and `slice` functions come to the
rescue! \index{arrange}\index{slice}

The `arrange` function allows us to order the rows of a data frame by the
values of a particular column. Figure \@ref(fig:img-arrange) details what arguments we need to specify to
use the `arrange` function. We need to pass the data frame as the first
argument to this function, and the variable to order by as the second argument.
Since we want to choose the ten Aboriginal languages most often reported as a mother tongue
language, we will use the `arrange` function to order the rows in our
`selected_lang` data frame by the `mother_tongue` column. We want to
arrange the rows in descending order (from largest to smallest),
so we pass the column to the `desc` function before using it as an argument.

(ref:img-arrange) Syntax for the `arrange` function.

``` {r img-arrange, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "(ref:img-arrange)", out.width="100%", fig.retina = 2}
image_read("img/intro/arrange_function.png") |>
  image_crop("1625x1900")
```

```{r}
arranged_lang <- arrange(selected_lang, by = desc(mother_tongue))
arranged_lang
```

Next we will use the `slice` function, which selects rows according to their
row number. Since we want to choose the most common ten languages, we will indicate we want the
rows 1 to 10 using the argument `1:10`.
```{r}
ten_lang <- slice(arranged_lang, 1:10)
ten_lang
```

## Adding and modifying columns using `mutate`

Recall that our data analysis question referred to the *count* of Canadians
that speak each of the top ten most commonly reported Aboriginal languages as
their mother tongue, and the `ten_lang` data frame indeed contains those
counts... But perhaps, seeing these numbers, we became curious about the
*percentage* of the population of Canada associated with each count. It is
common to come up with new data analysis questions in the process of answering
a first one&mdash;so fear not and explore! To answer this small
question-along-the-way, we need to divide each count in the `mother_tongue`
column by the total Canadian population according to the 2016
census&mdash;i.e., 35,151,728&mdash;and multiply it by 100. We can perform
this computation using the `mutate` function. We pass the `ten_lang`
data frame as its first argument, then specify the equation that computes the percentages
in the second argument. By using a new variable name on the left hand side of the equation,
we will create a new column in the data frame; and if we use an existing name, we will
modify that variable. In this case, we will opt to
create a new column called `mother_tongue_percent`.

```{r}
canadian_population = 35151728
ten_lang_percent = mutate(ten_lang, mother_tongue_percent = 100 * mother_tongue / canadian_population)
ten_lang_percent
```

The `ten_lang_percent` data frame shows that
the ten Aboriginal languages in the `ten_lang` data frame were spoken
as a mother tongue by between 0.008% and 0.18% of the Canadian population.


## Exploring data with visualizations

We have now answered our initial question by generating the `ten_lang` table!
Are we done? Well, not quite; tables are almost never the best way to present
the result of your analysis to your audience. Even the `ten_lang` table with
only two columns presents some difficulty: for example, you have to scrutinize
the table quite closely to get a sense for the relative numbers of speakers of
each language. When you move on to more complicated analyses, this issue only
gets worse. In contrast, a *visualization* would convey this information in a much
more easily understood format.
Visualizations are a great tool for summarizing information to help you
effectively communicate with your audience, and
creating effective data visualizations \index{visualization} is an essential component of any data
analysis. In this section we will develop a visualization of the
 ten Aboriginal languages that were most often reported in 2016 as mother tongues in
Canada, as well as the number of people that speak each of them.

### Using `ggplot` to create a bar plot

In our data set, we can see that `language` and `mother_tongue` are in separate
columns (or variables). In addition, there is a single row (or observation) for each language.
The data are, therefore, in what we call a *tidy data* format. Tidy data is a
fundamental concept and will be a significant focus in the remainder of this
book: many of the functions from `tidyverse` require tidy data, including the
`ggplot` \index{ggplot} function that we will use shortly for our visualization. We will
formally introduce tidy data in Chapter \@ref(wrangling).

We will make a bar plot to visualize our data. A bar plot \index{plot|see{visualization}}\index{visualization|see{ggplot}}\index{visualization!bar} is a chart where the
lengths of the bars represent certain values, like counts or proportions. We
will make a bar plot using the `mother_tongue` and `language` columns from our
`ten_lang` data frame. To create a bar plot of these two variables using the
`ggplot` function, we must specify the data frame, which variables
to put on the x and y axes, and what kind of plot to create. The `ggplot`
function and its common usage is illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:img-ggplot).
Figure \@ref(fig:barplot-mother-tongue) shows the resulting bar plot
generated by following the instructions in Figure \@ref(fig:img-ggplot).

(ref:img-ggplot) Creating a bar plot with the `ggplot` function.

```{r img-ggplot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "(ref:img-ggplot)", out.width="100%", fig.retina = 2}
image_read("img/intro/ggplot_function.png") |>
  image_crop("1625x1900")
```

```{r barplot-mother-tongue, fig.width=5, fig.height=3.1, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Bar plot of the ten Aboriginal languages most often reported by Canadian residents as their mother tongue. Note that this visualization is not done yet; there are still improvements to be made."}
ggplot(ten_lang, aes(x = language, y = mother_tongue)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

### Formatting ggplot objects

It is exciting that we can already visualize our data to help answer our
question, but we are not done yet! We can (and should) do more to improve the
interpretability of the data visualization that we created. For example, by
default, R uses the column names as the axis labels. Usually these
column names do not have enough information about the variable in the column.
We really should replace this default with a more informative label. For the
example above, R uses the column name `mother_tongue` as the label for the
y axis, but most people will not know what that is. And even if they did, they
will not know how we measured this variable, or the group of people on which the
measurements were taken. An axis label that reads "Mother Tongue (Number of
Canadian Residents)" would be much more informative.

Adding additional layers \index{plot!layers} to our visualizations that we create in `ggplot` is
one common and easy way to improve and refine our data visualizations. New
layers are added to `ggplot` objects using the `+` symbol. For example, we can
use the `xlab` (short for x axis label) \index{ggplot!xlab} and `ylab` (short for y axis label) \index{ggplot!ylab} functions
to add layers where we specify meaningful
and informative labels for the x and y axes. \index{plot!axis labels} Again, since we are specifying
words (e.g. `"Mother Tongue (Number of Canadian Residents)"`) as arguments to
`xlab` and `ylab`, we surround them with double quotation marks. We can add many more
layers to format the plot further, and we will explore these in Chapter
\@ref(viz).

(ref:barplot-mother-tongue-labs) Bar plot of the ten Aboriginal languages most often reported by Canadian residents as their mother tongue with x and y labels. Note that this visualization is not done yet; there are still improvements to be made.

```{r barplot-mother-tongue-labs, fig.width=5, fig.height=3.6, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "(ref:barplot-mother-tongue-labs)", fig.pos = "H", out.extra=""}
ggplot(ten_lang, aes(x = language, y = mother_tongue)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Language") +
  ylab("Mother Tongue (Number of Canadian Residents)")
```

The result is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:barplot-mother-tongue-labs).
This is already quite an improvement! Let's tackle the next major issue with the visualization
in Figure \@ref(fig:barplot-mother-tongue-labs): the overlapping x axis labels, which are
currently making it difficult to read the different language names.
One solution is to rotate the plot such that the bars are horizontal rather than vertical.
To accomplish this, we will swap the x and y coordinate axes:

```{r barplot-mother-tongue-flipped, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, fig.pos = "H", out.extra="", warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Horizontal bar plot of the ten Aboriginal languages most often reported by Canadian residents as their mother tongue. There are no more serious issues with this visualization, but it could be refined further."}
ggplot(ten_lang, aes(x = mother_tongue, y = language)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Mother Tongue (Number of Canadian Residents)") +
  ylab("Language")
```

Another big step forward, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:barplot-mother-tongue-flipped)! There
are no more serious issues with the visualization. Now comes time to refine
the visualization to make it even more well-suited to answering the question
we asked earlier in this chapter. For example, the visualization could be made more transparent by
organizing the bars according to the number of Canadian residents reporting
each language, rather than in alphabetical order. We can reorder the bars using
the `reorder` \index{reorder} function, which orders a variable (here `language`) based on the
values of the second variable (`mother_tongue`).

\newpage

```{r barplot-mother-tongue-reorder, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Bar plot of the ten Aboriginal languages most often reported by Canadian residents as their mother tongue with bars reordered."}
ggplot(ten_lang, aes(x = mother_tongue,
                     y = reorder(language, mother_tongue))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Mother Tongue (Number of Canadian Residents)") +
  ylab("Language")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:barplot-mother-tongue-reorder) provides a very clear and well-organized
answer to our original question; we can see what the ten most often reported Aboriginal languages
were, according to the 2016 Canadian census, and how many people speak each of them. For
instance, we can see that the Aboriginal language most often reported was Cree
n.o.s. with over 60,000 Canadian residents reporting it as their mother tongue.

> **Note:** "n.o.s." means "not otherwise specified", so Cree n.o.s. refers to
> individuals who reported Cree as their mother tongue. In this data set, the
> Cree languages include the following categories: Cree n.o.s., Swampy Cree,
> Plains Cree, Woods Cree, and a 'Cree not included elsewhere' category (which
> includes Moose Cree, Northern East Cree and Southern East Cree)
> [@language2016].

### Putting it all together

In the block of code below, we put everything from this chapter together, with a few
modifications. In particular, we have actually skipped the
`select` step that we did above; since you specify the variable names to plot
in the `ggplot` function, you don't actually need to `select` the columns in advance
when creating a visualization. We have also provided *comments* next to
many of the lines of code below using the
hash symbol `#`. When R sees a `#` sign, \index{comment} \index{aaacommentsymb@\#|see{comment}} it
will ignore all of the text that
comes after the symbol on that line. So you can use comments to explain lines
of code for others, and perhaps more importantly, your future self!
It's good practice to get in the habit of
commenting your code to improve its readability.

This exercise demonstrates the power of R. In relatively few lines of code, we
performed an entire data science workflow with a highly effective data
visualization! We asked a question, loaded the data into R, wrangled the data
(using `filter`, `arrange` and `slice`) and created a data visualization to
help answer our question. In this chapter, you got a quick taste of the data
science workflow; continue on with the next few chapters to learn each of
these steps in much more detail!

```{r nachos-to-cheesecake, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Putting it all together: bar plot of the ten Aboriginal languages most often reported by Canadian residents as their mother tongue."}
library(tidyverse)

# load the data set
can_lang <- read_csv("data/can_lang.csv")

# obtain the 10 most common Aboriginal languages
aboriginal_lang <- filter(can_lang, category == "Aboriginal languages")
arranged_lang <- arrange(aboriginal_lang, by = desc(mother_tongue))
ten_lang <- slice(arranged_lang, 1:10)

# create the visualization
ggplot(ten_lang, aes(x = mother_tongue,
                     y = reorder(language, mother_tongue))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Mother Tongue (Number of Canadian Residents)") +
  ylab("Language")
```

## Accessing documentation

There are many R functions in the `tidyverse` package (and beyond!), and
nobody can be expected to remember what every one of them does
or all of the arguments we have to give them. Fortunately, R provides
the `?` symbol, which
\index{aaaquestionmark@?|see{documentation}}
\index{help|see{documentation}}
\index{documentation} provides an easy way to pull up the documentation for
most functions quickly. To use the `?` symbol to access documentation, you
just put the name of the function you are curious about after the `?` symbol.
For example, if you had forgotten what the `filter` function
did or exactly what arguments to pass in, you could run the following
code:

```
?filter
```

Figure \@ref(fig:01-help) shows the documentation that will pop up,
including a high-level description of the function, its arguments,
a description of each, and more. Note that you may find some of the
text in the documentation a bit too technical right now
(for example, what is `dbplyr`, and what is a lazy data frame?).
Fear not: as you work through this book, many of these terms will be introduced
to you, and slowly but surely you will become more adept at understanding and navigating
documentation like that shown in Figure \@ref(fig:01-help). But do keep in mind that the documentation
is not written to *teach* you about a function; it is just there as a reference to *remind*
you about the different arguments and usage of functions that you have already learned about elsewhere.

(ref:01-help) The documentation for the `filter` function, including a high-level description, a list of arguments and their meanings, and more.


```{r 01-help, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "(ref:01-help)", fig.retina = 2, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/intro/help-filter.png")
