# Moving to your own machine {#move-to-your-own-machine}

## Overview

Throughout this book, we have assumed that you are working on a web-based platform
(e.g., JupyterHub) that already has Jupyter, R, a number of R packages, and Git set up and ready to use. 
In this chapter, you'll learn how to install all of that software on your own computer in case
you don't have a preconfigured JupyterHub available to you.

## Chapter learning objectives

By the end of the chapter, students will be able to:

- install Git and the miniconda Python distribution
- install and launch a local instance of JupyterLab with the R kernel
- download files from a JupyterHub for later local use

## Installing software on your own computer

In this section we will provide instructions for installing the software 
required by this book on our own computer. 
Given that installation instructions can vary widely based on the computer setup
we have created instructions for multiple operating systems.
In particular, the installation instructions below have been verified to work
on a computer that:

- runs one of the following operating systems: MacOS 10.15.X (Catalina); Ubuntu 20.04; Windows 10, version 2004.
- can connect to networks via a wireless connection
- uses a 64-bit CPU
- uses English as the default language

**For macOS users only:** Apple recently changed the default shell in the terminal to Zsh.
However, the programs we need work better with the Bash shell. Thus, we recomend you change 
the default shell to Bash by opening the terminal 
([how to video](https://youtu.be/5AJbWEWwnbY)) and typing:

```
chsh -s /bin/bash
```

You will have to quit all instances of open terminals and then restart the 
terminal for this to take effect.

### Git

As shown in the version control chapter, Git is a very useful tool for version
controlling your projects, as well as sharing your work with others.

**Windows:** To install
Git on Windows go to <https://git-scm.com/download/win> and download the windows 
version of git. Once the download has finished, run the installer and accept 
the default configuration for all pages.

**MacOS:** To install Git on Mac OS open the terminal and type the following command:

```
xcode-select --install
```

**Ubuntu:** To install Git on Ubuntu open the terminal and type the following commands:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```


### Miniconda

To run Jupyter notebooks on our computers we will need to install a program 
similar to the one we used as our web-based platform. One such program is 
JupyterLab. But JupyterLab relies on Python; we can install this via
the [miniconda Python package distribution](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

**Windows:** To install miniconda on Windows, download 
the [Python 3.8 64-bit version from here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe). 
Once the download has finished, run the installer and accept the default 
configuration for all pages. After installation, you can open the Anaconda Prompt
by opening the Start Menu and searching for the program called 
"Anaconda Prompt (miniconda3)". When this opens you will see a prompt similar to 
`(base) C:\Users\your_name`. 

**MacOS:** To install miniconda on MacOS, download 
the [Python 3.8 64-bit version from here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg). 
After the download has finished, run the installer and accept the default 
configuration for all pages.

**Ubuntu:** To install miniconda on Ubuntu, we first download
the [Python 3.8 64-bit version from here](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh). 
After the download has finished, open the terminal and execute the following 
commands:

```
bash path/to/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

> Note: most often this file is downloaded to the Downloads directory, and thus the command will look like this:
> ```
> bash Downloads/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
> ```


The instructions for the installation will then appear:

(1) Press Enter.
(2) Once the licence agreement shows, you can press space scroll down, or press `q` to skip reading it.
(3) Type `yes` and press enter to accept the licence agreement.
(4) Press enter to accept the default installation location.
(5) Type `yes` and press enter to instruct the installer to run `conda init`, which makes `conda` available from the terminal/shell.


### JupyterLab

With miniconda set up, we can now install JupyterLab and the Jupyter Git  extension. 
Type the following into the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or the terminal (MacOS and Ubuntu) and press enter:

```
conda install -c conda-forge -y jupyterlab
conda install -y nodejs=10.*
pip install --upgrade jupyterlab-git
jupyter lab build
```

To test that your JupyterLab installation is functional, you can type 
`jupyter lab` into the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or terminal (MacOS and Ubuntu) and press enter. This should open a new 
tab in your default browser with the JupyterLab interface. To exit out of 
JupyterLab you can click `File -> Shutdown`, or go to the terminal from which 
you launched JupyterLab, hold `Ctrl`, and press `c` twice.

### R and the IRkernel

To have R available to you in JupyterLab, you will need to install the R programming language and the IRkernel. 
To install these, type the following into 
the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or terminal (MacOS and Ubuntu):

```
conda install -c conda-forge -y r-base
conda install -c conda-forge -y r-irkernel
```

To improve the experience of using R in JupyterLab, we will add an extension 
that allows us to setup keyboard shortcuts for inserting text.
By default, this extension creates shortcuts for inserting two of the most common R 
operators: `<-` and `%>%`. Type the following in the Anaconda Prompt (Windows)
or terminal (MacOS and Ubuntu) and press  enter:

```
jupyter labextension install @techrah/text-shortcuts
jupyter lab build
```

### R packages

To install the packages used in this book, type the following in the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or terminal (MacOS and Ubuntu) and press enter:

```
conda install -c conda-forge -y \
  r-cowplot \
  r-ggally \
  r-gridextra \
  r-infer \
  r-kknn \
  r-rodbc \
  r-rpostgres \
  r-rsqlite \
  r-testthat \
  r-tidymodels \
  r-tinytex \
  unixodbc
```

### LaTeX

To be able to render `.ipynb` files to `.pdf` you need to install a LaTeX 
distribution. These can be quite large, so we will opt to use `tinytex`, a 
light-weight cross-platform, portable, and easy-to-maintain LaTeX distribution 
based on TeX Live. To install it open JupyterLab by typing `jupyter lab` 
in the Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or terminal (MacOS and Ubuntu) and press enter.
Then from JupyterLab open an R console and type the commands listed below and 
press Shift + enter to install `tinytex`:

```
tinytex::install_tinytex()
tinytex::tlmgr_install(c("eurosym", 
                         "adjustbox",
                         "caption",
                         "collectbox",
                         "enumitem",
                         "environ",
                         "fp",
                         "jknapltx",
                         "ms",
                         "oberdiek",
                         "parskip",
                         "pgf",
                         "rsfs",
                         "tcolorbox",
                         "titling",
                         "trimspaces",
                         "ucs",
                         "ulem",
                         "upquote"))
```

## Moving files to your computer

In the course that uses this textbook, students work on a web-based platform 
(a JupyterHub) to do their course work. This section is to help students
save their work from this platform at the end of the course. 

First in JupyterHub, open a terminal by clicking "terminal" in the Launcher tab. 
Next, type the following in the terminal to create a 
compressed `.zip` archive for the course work you are interested in downloading:

```
zip -r course_folder.zip your_course_folder
```

After the compressing process is complete, right-click on `course_folder.zip`
in the JupyterHub file browser
and click "Download". You should be able to use your computer's software to unzip
the compressed folder by double-clicking on it.
