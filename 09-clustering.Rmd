## Overview 
As part of exploratory data analysis, it is often helpful to see if there are
meaningful subgroups (or *clusters*) in the data; this grouping can be used 
for many purposes, such as generating new questions or improving predictive analyses. 
This chapter provides an introduction to clustering using the *K-means* algorithm,
including techniques to choose the number of clusters.

## Chapter learning objectives 
By the end of the chapter, students will be able to:

* Describe a case where clustering is appropriate, and what insight it might extract from the data.
* Explain the K-means clustering algorithm.
* Interpret the output of a K-means analysis.
* Identify when it is necessary to scale variables before clustering, and do this using R.
* Perform K-means clustering in R using `kmeans`.
* Use the elbow method to choose the number of clusters for K-means.
* Visualize the output of K-means clustering in R using coloured scatter plots.
* Describe the advantages, limitations and assumptions of the K-means clustering algorithm.

## Clustering
Clustering is a data analysis task involving separating a data set into
subgroups of related data. For example, we might use clustering to separate a
data set of documents into groups that correspond to topics, a data set of
human genetic information into groups that correspond to ancestral
subpopulations, or a data set of online customers into groups that correspond
to purchasing behaviours.  Once the data are separated, we can, for example,
use the subgroups to generate new questions about the data and follow up with a
predictive modelling exercise. In this course, clustering will be used only for
exploratory analysis, i.e., uncovering patterns in the data.  

Note that clustering is a fundamentally different kind of task than classification or
regression. In particular, both classification and regression are *supervised
tasks* where there is a *predictive target* (a class label or value), and we
have examples of past data with labels/values that help us predict those of
future data. By contrast, clustering is an *unsupervised task*, as we are
trying to understand and examine the structure of data without any labels to
help us. This approach has both advantages and disadvantages. Clustering
requires no additional annotation or input on the data. For example, it would
be nearly impossible to annotate all the articles on Wikipedia with human-made
topic labels. However, we can still cluster the articles without this
information to find groupings corresponding to topics automatically. 

However, because there is no predictive target, it is not as easy to evaluate
the "quality" of a clustering.  With classification, we can use a test data set
to assess prediction performance. In clustering, there is not a single good
choice for evaluation. In this book, we will use visualization to ascertain the
quality of a clustering, and leave rigorous evaluation for more advanced
courses.

**An illustrative example** 


Here we will present an illustrative example using a data set from the [{palmerpenguins} R data package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/). This data set was collected by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://lternet.edu/) and includes measurements for adult penguins near Palmer Station
[@palmerpenguins]. We have modified the data set for use in this chapter. Here we will focus on two variables measuring penguin bill length (in mm) and flipper length (mm), and we want to learn whether there are distinct types of penguins in our data. Understanding this might help us with species classification in a data-driven way.
```{r 09-penguins, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5, fig.cap = "Gentoo penguin. [@penguinsimage]", fig.retina = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Brown_Bluff-2016-Tabarin_Peninsula%E2%80%93Gentoo_penguin_%28Pygoscelis_papua%29_03.jpg")
```

Below we will work with `penguin_data`, a subset of 18 observations of the original data, which has already been scaled. We will discuss scaling for K-means in more detail later in this chapter.  
```{r 10-toy-example-data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

data <- read_csv("data/toy_penguins.csv") %>%
  mutate(cluster = as_factor(cluster)) %>%
  mutate(flipper_length_scaled = scale(flipper_length_mm), bill_length_scaled = scale(bill_length_mm))

penguin_data <- data %>% select(flipper_length_scaled, bill_length_scaled)
```

```{r 10-clustering}
penguin_data
```

```{r 10-toy-example-plot, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35, fig.cap = "Subset data of penguin scaled bill length versus flipper length."}
base <- ggplot(data, aes(x = flipper_length_scaled, y = bill_length_scaled)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Flipper Length (scaled)") +
  ylab("Bill Length (scaled)")
base
```

Based on the visualization in figure \@ref(fig:10-toy-example-plot), we might
suspect there are a few subtypes of penguins, selected from combinations of
high/low flipper length and high/low bill length. How do we find this grouping
automatically, and how do we pick the number of subtypes? The way to rigorously
separate the data into groups is to use a clustering algorithm.
In this chapter, we will focus on the *K-means* algorithm, a widely-used
and often very effective clustering method, combined with the *elbow method* for
selecting the number of clusters. This procedure will separate the data into 
the following groups denoted by colour:

```{r 10-toy-example-clustering, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(data, aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled, colour = cluster)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Flipper Length (scaled)") +
  ylab("Bill Length (scaled)")
```

What are the labels for these groups? Unfortunately, we don't have any. K-means,
like almost all clustering algorithms, just outputs meaningless "cluster labels"
that are typically whole numbers: 1, 2, 3, etc. But in a simple case like this,
where we can easily visualize the clusters on a scatter plot, we can give
human-made labels to the groups using their positions on
the plot:

- small flipper length and small bill length (<font color="#F8766D">pink cluster</font>), 
- small flipper length and large bill length (<font color="#00BA38">green cluster</font>).
- and large flipper length and large bill  length (<font color="#619CFF">blue cluster</font>).

Once we have made these determinations, we can use them to inform our species
classifications or ask further questions about our data. For example, we might
be interested in understanding the relationship between flipper length and bill
length, and that relationship may differ depending on the type of penguin we
have. 

## K-means 

### Measuring cluster quality

```{r 10-toy-example-clus1, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# clus1 <- tibble(loyalty = c(7, 7.5, 8, 7, 8),
#               csat = c(1, 1, 2, 2, 3),
#               )
clus1 <- filter(data, cluster == 2) %>%
  select(bill_length_scaled, flipper_length_scaled)

# clus1_center <- clus1 %>% summarize(csat = mean(csat), loyalty = mean(loyalty))
```

The K-means algorithm is a procedure that groups data into K clusters.
It starts with an initial clustering of the data, and then iteratively
improves it by making adjustments to the assignment of data
to clusters until it cannot improve any further. But how do we measure
the "quality" of a clustering, and what does it mean to improve it? 
In K-means clustering, we measure the quality of a cluster by its
*within-cluster sum-of-squared-distances* (WSSD). Computing this involves two steps.
First, we find the cluster centers by computing the mean of each variable 
over data points in the cluster. For example, suppose we have a 
cluster containing four observations, and we are using two variables, $x$ and $y$, to cluster the data.
Then we would compute the $x$ and $y$ variables, $\mu_x$ and $\mu_y$, of the cluster center via

$$\mu_x = \frac{1}{4}(x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4) \quad \mu_y = \frac{1}{4}(y_1+y_2+y_3+y_4).$$

In the first cluster from the example, there are `r nrow(clus1)` data points. These are shown with their cluster center 
(``r paste("flipper_length_scaled =", round(mean(clus1$flipper_length_scaled),2))`` and ``r paste("bill_length_scaled =", round(mean(clus1$bill_length_scaled),2))``) highlighted in figure \@ref(fig:10-toy-example-clus1-center).

```{r 10-toy-example-clus1-center, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35, fig.cap = "Cluster 1 from the toy example, with center highlighted."}
base <- ggplot(clus1) +
  geom_point(aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled)) +
  labs(x = "Flipper Length (scaled)", y = "Bill Length (scaled)") +
  xlim(c(
    min(clus1$flipper_length_scaled) - 0.25 * sd(clus1$flipper_length_scaled),
    max(clus1$flipper_length_scaled) + 0.25 * sd(clus1$flipper_length_scaled)
  )) +
  ylim(c(
    min(clus1$bill_length_scaled) - 0.25 * sd(clus1$bill_length_scaled),
    max(clus1$bill_length_scaled) + 0.25 * sd(clus1$bill_length_scaled)
  )) +
  geom_point(aes(y = mean(bill_length_scaled), x = mean(flipper_length_scaled), colour = "red", size = 2.5)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
base
```

The second step in computing the WSSD is to add up the squared distance between each point in the cluster and the cluster center.
We use the straight-line / Euclidean distance formula that we learned about in the classification chapter.
In the `r nrow(clus1)`-observation cluster example above, we would compute the WSSD $S^2$ via

$$S^2 = \left((x_1 - \mu_x)^2 + (y_1 - \mu_y)^2\right) + \left((x_2 - \mu_x)^2 + (y_2 - \mu_y)^2\right) +\left((x_3 - \mu_x)^2 + (y_3 - \mu_y)^2\right) \left((x_4 - \mu_x)^2 + (y_4 - \mu_y)^2\right).$$

These distances are denoted by lines in figure \@ref(fig:10-toy-example-clus1-dists) for the first cluster of the penguin data example. 

```{r 10-toy-example-clus1-dists, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35, fig.cap = "Cluster 1 from the toy example, with distances to the center highlighted."}
base <- ggplot(clus1) +
  geom_point(aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled)) +
  labs(x = "Flipper Length (scaled)", y = "Bill Length (scaled)") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

mn <- clus1 %>% summarize(flipper_length_scaled = mean(flipper_length_scaled), bill_length_scaled = mean(bill_length_scaled))
for (i in 1:nrow(clus1)) {
  base <- base + geom_segment(
    x = unlist(mn[1, "flipper_length_scaled"]), y = unlist(mn[1, "bill_length_scaled"]),
    xend = unlist(clus1[i, "flipper_length_scaled"]), yend = unlist(clus1[i, "bill_length_scaled"])
  )
}
base <- base + geom_point(aes(y = mean(bill_length_scaled), x = mean(flipper_length_scaled), colour = "red", size = 2.5))
base
```

The larger the value of $S^2$, the more spread-out the cluster is, since large $S^2$ means that points are far from the cluster center.
Note, however, that "large" is relative to *both* the scale of the variables for clustering *and* the number of points in the cluster. A cluster where points are very close to the center might still have a large $S^2$ if there are many data points in the cluster. 

### The clustering algorithm

We begin the K-means algorithm by picking K, and uniformly randomly assigning data to the K clusters. 
Then K-means consists of two major steps that attempt to minimize the
sum of WSSDs over all the clusters, i.e. the *total WSSD*:

1. **Center update:** Compute the center of each cluster.
2. **Label update:** Reassign each data point to the cluster with the nearest center.

These two steps are repeated until the cluster assignments no longer change.
For example, in the penguin data example, our initialization might look like this:
<center>
```{r 10-toy-kmeans-init, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35, fig.cap = "Random initialization of labels."}
library(gridExtra)
set.seed(14)
penguin_data["label"] <- factor(sample(1:3, nrow(penguin_data), replace = T))

plt_lbl <- ggplot(penguin_data, aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled, colour = label)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  xlab("Flipper Length (scaled)") +
  ylab("Bill Length (scaled)") +
  # xlim(c(0, 10)) +
  # ylim(c(0, 10)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
print(plt_lbl)
```
</center>

And the first four iterations of K-means would look like (each row corresponds to an iteration,
where the left column depicts the center update, 
and the right column depicts the reassignment of data to clusters): 
<center>
**Center Update**  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;**Label Update**
```{r 10-toy-kmeans-iter, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
for (i in 1:4) {
  # compute centers
  centers <- penguin_data %>%
    group_by(label) %>%
    summarize_all(funs(mean))
  nclus <- nrow(centers)
  # replot with centers
  plt_ctr <- ggplot(penguin_data, aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled, colour = label)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    xlab("Flipper Length (scaled)") +
    ylab("Bill Length (scaled)") +
    # xlim(c(0, 10)) +
    # ylim(c(0, 10)) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    geom_point(data = centers, aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled, fill = label), size = 5, shape = 21, stroke = 2, colour = "black")

  # reassign labels
  dists <- rbind(centers, penguin_data) %>%
    select("flipper_length_scaled", "bill_length_scaled") %>%
    dist() %>%
    as.matrix()
  dists <- as_tibble(dists[-(1:nclus), 1:nclus])
  penguin_data <- penguin_data %>% mutate(label = apply(dists, 1, function(x) names(x)[which.min(x)]))

  plt_lbl <- ggplot(penguin_data, aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled, colour = label)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    xlab("Flipper Length (scaled)") +
    ylab("Bill Length (scaled)") +
    # xlim(c(0, 10)) +
    # ylim(c(0, 10)) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    geom_point(data = centers, aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled, fill = label), size = 5, shape = 21, stroke = 2, colour = "black")

  # to generate the animated version, get rid of grid.arrange and use the below two lines
  # set the figure width to 4.35 too
  # print(plt_ctr)
  # print(plt_lbl)
  grid.arrange(plt_ctr, plt_lbl, nrow = 1)
}
```
</center>

Note that at this point, we can terminate the algorithm since none of the assignments changed
in the fourth iteration; both the centers and labels will remain the same from this point onward.

### Random restarts

Unlike the classification and regression models we studied in previous chapters, K-means can get "stuck" in a bad solution.
For example, if we were unlucky and initialized K-means with the following labels:
<center>
```{r 10-toy-kmeans-bad-init, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35, fig.cap = "Random initialization of labels."}
set.seed(10)
penguin_data["label"] <- factor(sample(1:3, nrow(penguin_data), replace = T))

plt_lbl <- ggplot(penguin_data, aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled, colour = label)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  xlab("Flipper Length (scaled)") +
  ylab("Bill Length (scaled)") +
  #  xlim(c(0, 10)) +
  #  ylim(c(0, 10)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
print(plt_lbl)
```
</center>

Then the iterations of K-means would look like:
<center>
**Center Update**  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;**Label Update**
```{r 10-toy-kmeans-bad-iter, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
for (i in 1:5) {
  # compute centers
  centers <- penguin_data %>%
    group_by(label) %>%
    summarize_all(funs(mean))
  nclus <- nrow(centers)
  # replot with centers
  plt_ctr <- ggplot(penguin_data, aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled, colour = label)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    xlab("Flipper Length (scaled)") +
    ylab("Bill Length (scaled)") +
    # xlim(c(0, 10)) +
    # ylim(c(0, 10)) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    geom_point(data = centers, aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled, fill = label), size = 5, shape = 21, stroke = 2, colour = "black")

  # reassign labels
  dists <- rbind(centers, penguin_data) %>%
    select("flipper_length_scaled", "bill_length_scaled") %>%
    dist() %>%
    as.matrix()
  dists <- as_tibble(dists[-(1:nclus), 1:nclus])
  penguin_data <- penguin_data %>% mutate(label = apply(dists, 1, function(x) names(x)[which.min(x)]))

  plt_lbl <- ggplot(penguin_data, aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled, colour = label)) +
    geom_point(size = 2) +
    xlab("Flipper Length (scaled)") +
    ylab("Bill Length (scaled)") +
    # xlim(c(0, 10)) +
    # ylim(c(0, 10)) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    geom_point(data = centers, aes(y = bill_length_scaled, x = flipper_length_scaled, fill = label), size = 5, shape = 21, stroke = 2, colour = "black")

  # print(plt_ctr)
  # print(plt_lbl)
  grid.arrange(plt_ctr, plt_lbl, nrow = 1)
}
```
</center>

This looks like a relatively bad clustering of the data, but K-means cannot improve it.
To solve this problem when clustering data using K-means, we should randomly re-initialize the labels a few times, run K-means for each initialization,
and pick the clustering that has the lowest final total WSSD.

### Choosing K

In order to cluster data using K-means, we also have to pick the number of clusters, K.
But unlike in classification, we have no data labels and cannot perform
cross-validation with some measure of model prediction error.
Further, if K is chosen too small, then multiple clusters get grouped together;
if K is too large, then clusters get subdivided. In both cases, we will potentially miss
interesting structure in the data. For example, take a look below at the K-means
clustering of our penguin flipper and bill length data for a number of clusters
ranging from 1 to 9.

```{r 10-toy-kmeans-vary-k, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 10, fig.width = 12, fig.cap = "Clustering of the penguin data for # clusters ranging from 1 to 9."}
library(broom)
set.seed(3)
kclusts <- tibble(k = 1:9) %>%
  mutate(
    kclust = map(k, ~ kmeans(penguin_data[-3], .x)),
    tidied = map(kclust, tidy),
    glanced = map(kclust, glance),
    augmented = map(kclust, augment, penguin_data[-3])
  )

clusters <- kclusts %>%
  unnest(tidied)

assignments <- kclusts %>%
  unnest(augmented)

clusterings <- kclusts %>%
  unnest(glanced, .drop = TRUE)

assignments$k <- factor(assignments$k)
levels(assignments$k) <- c("1 Cluster", "2 Clusters", "3 Clusters", "4 Clusters", "5 Clusters", "6 Clusters", "7 Clusters", "8 Clusters", "9 Clusters")

clusters$k <- factor(clusters$k)
levels(clusters$k) <- c("1 Cluster", "2 Clusters", "3 Clusters", "4 Clusters", "5 Clusters", "6 Clusters", "7 Clusters", "8 Clusters", "9 Clusters")


p1 <- ggplot(assignments, aes(flipper_length_scaled, bill_length_scaled)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = .cluster, size = 3)) +
  facet_wrap(~k) +
  labs(x = "Flipper Length (scaled)", y = "Bill Length (scaled)", colour = "Cluster") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20), legend.position = "none") +
  geom_point(data = clusters %>% mutate(flipper_length_scaled = x2, bill_length_scaled = x1), aes(fill = cluster), colour = "black", size = 5, shape = 21, stroke = 2)

p1
```

If we set K less than 3, then the clustering merges separate groups of data; this causes a large 
total WSSD, since the cluster center (denoted by an "x") is not close to any of the data in the cluster. On 
the other hand, if we set K greater than 3, the clustering subdivides subgroups of data; this does indeed still 
decrease the total WSSD, but by only a *diminishing amount*. If we plot the total WSSD versus the number of 
clusters, we see that the decrease in total WSSD levels off (or forms an "elbow shape") when we reach roughly 
the right number of clusters.
<center>
```{r 10-toy-kmeans-elbow, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 10, fig.cap = "Total WSSD for # clusters ranging from 1 to 9."}
p2 <- ggplot(clusterings, aes(x = k, y = tot.withinss)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_line() +
  # annotate(geom = "line", x = 4, y = 35, xend = 2.65, yend = 27, arrow = arrow(length = unit(2, "mm"))) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 4, y = 17, xend = 3.1, yend = 6), arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm"))) +
  annotate("text", x = 4.4, y = 19, label = "Elbow", size = 7, colour = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Number of Clusters", y = "Total WSSD") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:9)
p2
```

## Data pre-processing for K-means

Similar to K-nearest neighbours classification and regression, K-means 
clustering uses straight-line distance to decide which points are similar to 
each other. Therefore, the *scale* of each of the variables in the data
will influence which cluster data points end up being assigned.
Variables with a large scale will have a much larger 
effect on deciding cluster assignment than variables with a small scale. 
To address this problem, we typically standardize our data before clustering,
which ensures that each variable has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.
The `scale` function in R can be used to do this. 
We show an example of how to use this function 
below using an unscaled version of data set in this chapter:

```{r 10-get-unscaled-data, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
unscaled_data <- read_csv("data/toy_penguins.csv") %>%
  select(bill_length_mm, flipper_length_mm)
```

```{r 10-mapdf-scale-data}
unscaled_data
scaled_data <- map_df(unscaled_data, scale)
scaled_data
```

## K-means in R

To perform K-means clustering in R, we use the `kmeans` function. It takes at
least two arguments: the data frame containing the data you wish to cluster,
and K, the number of clusters (here we choose K = 3). Note that since the K-means
algorithm uses a random initialization of assignments, we need to set the random
seed to make the clustering reproducible.

```{r 10-kmeans}
set.seed(1234)
penguin_clust <- kmeans(scaled_data, centers = 3)
penguin_clust
```

As you can see above, the clustering object returned by `kmeans` has a lot of information
that can be used to visualize the clusters, pick K, and evaluate the total WSSD.
To obtain this information in a tidy format, we will call in help 
from the `broom` package. Let's start by visualizing the clustering
as a coloured scatter plot. To do that
we use the `augment` function, which takes in the model and the original data
frame, and returns a data frame with the data and the cluster assignments for
each point:

```{r 10-plot-clusters-1}
clustered_data <- augment(penguin_clust, scaled_data)
clustered_data
```

Now that we have this information in a tidy data frame, we can make a visualization
of the cluster assignments for each point:

```{r 10-plot-clusters-2, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35}

cluster_plot <- ggplot(clustered_data,
  aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm, colour = .cluster),
  size = 2
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Flipper Length (scaled)", y = "Bill Length (scaled)", colour = "Cluster")
cluster_plot
```

As mentioned above, we also need to select K by finding
where the "elbow" occurs in the plot of total WSSD versus the number of clusters. 
We can obtain the total WSSD (`tot.withinss`) from our
clustering using `broom`'s `glance` function. For example:

```{r 10-glance}
glance(penguin_clust)
```

To calculate the total WSSD for a variety of Ks, we will
create a data frame with a column named `k` with rows containing
each value of K we want to run K-means with (here, 1 to 9). 

```{r 10-choose-k-part1}
penguin_clust_ks <- tibble(k = 1:9)
penguin_clust_ks
```

Then we use `map` to apply the `kmeans` function to each
K. However, we need to use `map` a little bit differently than we have
before. This is because we need to iterate over `k`, which is the *second argument* 
to the `kmeans` function. In the past, we have used `map` only to iterate over values of the
*first argument* of a function. Since that is the default, we could simply 
write `map(data_frame, function_name)`. This won't work here; we need to 
provide our data frame as the first argument to the `kmeans` function.

The solution is to create something called an *anonymous function*. 
An anonymous function is a function that has no name,
unlike other functions you've seen so far (`kmeans`, `select`, etc). 
To do this we will write our map statement like this:

```
map(penguin_clust_ks, function(k) kmeans(scaled_data, k))
```

The anonymous function in the above call is `function(k) kmeans(scaled_data, k)`.
This function takes a single argument (`k`) and evaluates `kmeans(scaled_data, k)`.
Since `k` is the *first* (and only) argument to the function, we can use `map` just
like we did before! The rest of the call above does just that -- it passes each row of
`penguin_clust_ks` to our anonymous function.

Below, we execute this `map` call inside of a `mutate` call on the 
`penguin_clust_ks` data frame and get a list column that contains a K-means
clustering object for each value of K we had:

```{r 10-choose-k-part2}
penguin_clust_ks <- tibble(k = 1:9) %>%
  mutate(penguin_clusts = map(k, function(ks) kmeans(scaled_data, ks)))
penguin_clust_ks
```

Next, we use `map` again to apply `glance` to each of the K-means
clustering objects to get the clustering statistics (including WSSD). The output
of glance is a data frame, and so we get another list column. This results in a 
complex data frame with 3 columns, one for K, one for the 
K-means clustering objects, and one for the clustering statistics:

```{r 10-choose-k-part3}
penguin_clust_ks <- tibble(k = 1:9) %>%
  mutate(
    penguin_clusts = map(k, ~ kmeans(scaled_data, .x)),
    glanced = map(penguin_clusts, glance)
  )
penguin_clust_ks
```

Finally we extract the total WSSD from the `glanced` column. Given that each 
item in this column is a data frame, we will need to use the `unnest` function 
to unpack the data frames into simpler column data types. 

```{r 10-get-total-within-sumsqs}
clustering_statistics <- penguin_clust_ks %>%
  unnest(glanced)

clustering_statistics
```

Now that we have `tot.withinss` and `k` as columns in a data frame, we can make a line plot 
and search for the "elbow" to find which value of K to use. 


```{r 10-plot-choose-k, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35}
elbow_plot <- ggplot(clustering_statistics, aes(x = k, y = tot.withinss)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("K") +
  ylab("Total within-cluster sum of squares") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:9)
elbow_plot
```

It looks like 3 clusters is the right choice for this data.
But why is there a "bump" in the total WSSD plot here? Shouldn't total WSSD always
decrease as we add more clusters? Technically yes, but remember:  K-means can 
get "stuck" in a bad solution. Unfortunately, for K = 8 we had an unlucky initialization
and found a bad clustering! We can help prevent finding a bad clustering by trying a 
few different random initializations via the `nstart` argument (here we use 10 restarts). 

```{r 10-choose-k-nstart, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 4.35}
penguin_clust_ks <- tibble(k = 1:9) %>%
  mutate(
    penguin_clusts = map(k, ~ kmeans(scaled_data, nstart = 10, .x)),
    glanced = map(penguin_clusts, glance)
  )

clustering_statistics <- penguin_clust_ks %>%
  unnest(glanced)

elbow_plot <- ggplot(clustering_statistics, aes(x = k, y = tot.withinss)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  xlab("K") +
  ylab("Total within-cluster sum of squares") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:9)
elbow_plot
```

- Chapter 10 of [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) [-@james2013introduction] provides a great next stop in the process of learning about clustering and unsupervised learning in general. In the realm of clustering specifically, it provides a great companion introduction to K-means, but also covers *hierarchical* clustering for when you expect there to be subgroups, and then subgroups within subgroups, etc. in your data. In the realm of more general unsupervised learning, it covers *principal components analysis (PCA)*, which is a very popular technique in scientific applications for reducing the number of predictors in a dataset.
