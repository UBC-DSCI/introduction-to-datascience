# Cleaning and wrangling data {#wrangling}

## Overview 

This chapter is centred around defining tidy data, 
a data format that is suitable for analysis, 
and the tools needed to transform raw data into this format.
This will be presented in the context of a real-world data science application, 
providing more practice working through a whole case study.

## Chapter learning objectives
By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to:

- define the term "tidy data"
- discuss the advantages and disadvantages of storing data in a tidy data format
- define what vector and data frames are in R, and describe how they relate to each other
- describe the types of data that can be stored in integer, double, character, logical, and factor vectors in R
- recall and use the following tidyverse functions and operators for their intended data wrangling tasks:
    - `select`
    - `filter`
    - `mutate`
    - `|>`
    - `c()`
    - `%in%`
    - `pivot_longer`
    - `pivot_wider`
    - `separate`
    - `summarize`
    - `group_by`
    - `map`

## Data frames and Vectors

We now know how to load data into R from various file formats.
Given that most of the tools we have used to do this represent the data as a 
data frame in R, we will spend some time learning more about data frames
to deepen our understanding of them. This will be useful prerequisite knowledge
to use and manipulate these objects in our data analysis.

### What is a data frame?

To define a **data frame**, first, let's introduce a few commonly used terms in statistics:

- **observation** -  all of the quantities or a qualities we collect from a given entity/object (*e.g.,* adult)
- **variable** - any characteristic, number, or quantity that can be measured or collected  (*e.g.,* adult height)
-  **value** - a single collected quantity or a quality from a given entity/object (*e.g.,* the adult height of a particular person)

From a data perspective, a data frame is a rectangle where the rows are the observations:

```{r 02-setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(canlang)
write_csv(region_lang, "data/region_lang.csv")
```

```{r 02-obs, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Rows are observations in a data frame", fig.retina = 2, out.width = "600"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/obs.jpeg")
```

and the columns are the variables:


```{r 02-vars, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Columns are variables in a data frame", fig.retina = 2, out.width = "650"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vars.jpeg")
```

From a computer programming perspective, in R, a data frame is a special subtype of a list object whose elements (columns) are *vectors*. For example, the data frame in Figure \@ref(fig:02-vectors) has three vectors whose names are `region`, `year` and `population`.

```{r 02-vectors, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Data frame with 3 vectors", fig.retina = 2, out.width = "650"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vectors.jpeg")
```

### What is a vector?

In R, **vectors** are objects that can contain one or more elements. The vector elements are ordered, and they must all be of the same *data type*. R has several different basic data types, as shown in table \@ref(tab:datatype-table).

In the vector shown in Figure \@ref(fig:02-vector), the elements are of integer type:

```{r 02-vector, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Example of a numeric type vector", fig.retina = 2, out.width = "600"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vector.jpeg")
```


You can create vectors in R using the concatenate `c()` function. 
To create the vector `year` in Figure \@ref(fig:02-vector) we write:
```{r}
year <- c(2015, 2013, 2011, 2016, 2018)
year
```

Table: (\#tab:datatype-table) Basic data types in R

| Data type | Description | Example |
|-------|------------------|-----------|
| character | Letters or numbers surrounded by quotes |  "1" , "Hello world!" |
|  double  | Numbers with decimals values         | 1.2333 | 
|  integer | Numbers that do not contain decimals | 1L, 20L (where "L" tells R to store as an integer) | 
| logical |  A value of true and false | `TRUE`, `FALSE` | 
| factor  | Used to represent data with a limited number of values | a `size` variable with levels "large", "medium" and "small" | 

>  "Numeric" is an umbrella term that includes integer and double data types.
> Most of the time when working with numbers in R they will be double types. For instance, a double data type is the default when you create a vector of numbers using `c()`, and when you read in whole numbers via `read_csv`.
> There are other basic data types in R, such as *raw* and *complex*, which we won't cover in this textbook. 
> We will go into more details about factors in chapter \@ref(viz).

### How are vectors different from a list?

Lists are also objects in R that have multiple elements, you can think of them as super-vectors. Vectors and lists differ by the requirement of element type consistency. All elements 
within a single vector must be of the same type (e.g., all elements are numbers), whereas elements within a single list can be of different 
types (e.g., characters, numbers, logicals and even other lists can be elements in the same list). 

```{r 02-vec-vs-list, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "A vector versus a list", fig.retina = 2, out.width = "600"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vec_vs_list.jpeg")
```


### What does this have to do with data frames?

As mentioned earlier, a data frame is really a special type of list
where the elements can only be vectors.
Representing data with such an object enables us to easily work with our data
in a tabular manner. It also allows us to have columns,
containing qualities or values, for different statistical variables linked
in a row for one observation - these columns cannot be independently sorted.
This is similar to a table in a database.

```{r 02-dataframe, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Data frame and vector types", fig.retina = 2, out.width = "650"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dataframe.jpeg")
```

The functions from the `tidyverse` package that we are using often give us a special class of data frame called a *tibble*. Tibbles have some additional features and benefits over the built-in data frame object. These include the ability to add grouping (and other useful) attributes and more predictable type preservation when subsetting. Because a tibble is just a data frame with some added features, we will collectively refer to both built-in R data frames and tibbles as data frames in this book.

> You can use the function `class` on a data object to assess whether a data frame is a built-in R data frame or a tibble. If the data object is a data frame `class` will return `"data.frame"`, whereas if the data object is a tibble it  will return `"tbl_df" "tbl" "data.frame"`. You can easily convert built-in R  data frames to tibbles using the `tidyverse` `as_tibble` function.

Vectors, data frames and lists are basic types of *data structures* in R which are core to most data analyses. We summarize them in table \@ref(tab:datastructure-table).

Table: (\#tab:datastructure-table) Basic data structures in R

| Data Structure | Description |
|------|------------------|
| vector | An ordered collection of one, or more, values of the *same data type* (e.g. all values are numeric). *Note: in R, a vector of length one is used to represent a single value.*  | 
| data frame | A list of *vectors* of the *same length*, which has column and row names. We typically use a data frame to represent a data set. | 
| list | An ordered collection of one, or more, values. The elements in the list can be of different data types. | 

> There are several other data structures in the R programming language (*e.g.,* matrices), however, they are beyond the scope of this book.

## Tidy Data

There are many ways a tabular data set can be organized. 
This chapter will focus on introducing the *tidy data* format of organization 
and how to make your raw (and likely messy) data tidy. 


### What is tidy data?

Tidy data satisfy the following three criteria [@wickham2014tidy]:

- each row is a single observation,
- each column is a single variable, and
- each value is a single cell (i.e., its row and column position in the data frame is not shared with another value)

```{r 02-tidy-image, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Tidy data", fig.retina = 2, out.width = "1150"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tidy_data.jpeg")
```

### Why is tidy data important in R?

First, tidy data is a straightforward way to work with data and thus, one of R's most popular plotting toolsets, the `ggplot2` package
(which is one of the packages that the `tidyverse` package loads), expects the
data to be in a tidy format. Second, most statistical analysis functions also
expect data in a tidy format. Given that both of these tasks are central in
almost all data analysis projects, it is well worth spending the time to get your
data into a tidy format upfront. Luckily there are many well-designed `tidyverse`
data cleaning/wrangling tools to help you easily tidy your data. Let's explore
them below!

### Going from wide to long (or tidy!) using `pivot_longer`
One common step to get data into a tidy format is to combine columns stored in
separate columns but are really part of the same variable. Data is often stored
in a wider, not tidy, format because this format is usually more intuitive for
human readability and understanding, and humans create data sets.

For example, in Figure \@ref(fig:02-wide-to-long), the table on the left is an
untidy format because the year values (2011, 2016) are listed as the column headers. 
One problem with using data in this format is that we don't know what the values
under each year represent in the table. Also, we can't easily access the year
values, so if we wanted to find the maximum year, for example, it's hard to do 
when the values are not in their own column. We can reshape this data set to a long format by creating a column called "year" and a column called "population," which is the table on the right.

```{r 02-wide-to-long, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Going from wide to long data", fig.retina = 2, out.width = "1150"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/wide_to_long.jpeg")
```
We can use the function `pivot_longer`, which combines columns, making the data frame longer and narrower. To learn how to use `pivot_longer`, we will work with the `region_lang_top5_cities_wide.csv` data set. This data set contains contains the counts of how many Canadians cited each language as their mother tongue for five major Canadian cities (Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton) from the 2016 Canadian census. Our data set is stored in an untidy format, as shown below:

```{r 02-tidyverse, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
lang_wide <- read_csv("data/region_lang_top5_cities_wide.csv")
lang_wide
```



What is wrong with our untidy format above? From a data analysis perspective, this format is not ideal because the values of the variable *region* (Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton) are stored as column names. Thus they are not easily accessible to the data analysis functions we will want to apply to our data set. Additionally, the values of the *mother tongue* variable are spread across multiple columns, which will prevent us from doing any desired visualization or statistical tasks until we combine them into one column. For instance, suppose we want to know the languages with the highest number of Canadians reporting it as their mother tongue among all five regions. This question would be tough to answer with the data in its current format. It would be much easier to answer if we tidy our data first. 

To accomplish this data transformation, we will use the `tidyverse` function `pivot_longer`. Figure \@ref(fig:img-pivot-longer) details what we need to specify to use `pivot_longer`.

```{r img-pivot-longer, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Syntax for the pivot_longer function", out.width="1100", fig.retina = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pivot_longer.jpeg")
```

For the above example, we use `pivot_longer` to combine the Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton columns into a single column called `region`, and create a column called `mother_tongue` that contains the count of how many Canadians report each language as their mother tongue for each metropolitan area. We use a colon `,` between Toronto, and Edmonton tells R to select all the columns in between Toronto and Edmonton: 
```{r}
lang_mother_tidy <- pivot_longer(lang_wide,
  cols = Toronto:Edmonton,
  names_to = "region",
  values_to = "mother_tongue"
)
lang_mother_tidy
```


> **Splitting code across lines**: *In the code above, the call to the `pivot_longer` function is split across several lines.*
> *This is allowed and encouraged when programming in R when your code line gets too long*
> *to read clearly. About 80 characters per line is recommended and when doing this, it is important to end the line with a comma `,` so that R*
> *knows the function should continue to the next line.*

Figure \@ref(fig:img-pivot-longer-with-table) summarizes how we reshaped our data to go from wide to long with the `pivot_longer` function. 
```{r img-pivot-longer-with-table, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Going from wide to long with the pivot_longer function", out.width="1100", fig.retina = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pivot_longer_with_table.jpeg")
```
The data above is now tidy because all three criteria for tidy data have now been met:

1. All the variables (`category`, `language`, `region` and ``mother_tongue``) are now their own columns in the data frame. 
2. Each observation, i.e., each `category`, `language`, `region`, and count of Canadians where that language is the mother tongue, are in a single row.
3. Each value is a single cell, i.e., its row, column position in the data frame is not shared with another value.

### Going from long to wide using `pivot_wider` {#pivot-wider}

Suppose we have observations spread across multiple rows rather than in a single row. For example, in Figure \@ref(fig:long-to-wide), the table on the left is an
untidy format because the `count` column contains two variables (population and commuter count) and each observation is split across two rows.
Using data in this format means it's harder to apply functions when the values are not in their own column. For example, finding the maximum number of commuters is possible to do with the untidy table but requires a few more steps and is cumbersome. We can reshape this data set to a wider format by creating a column called "population" and a column called "commuters", which is the table on the right.

```{r long-to-wide, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Going from long to wide data", fig.retina = 2, out.width = "1150"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/long_to_wide.jpeg")
```
To tidy this type of data in R, we can use the function `pivot_wider`, which generally increases the number of columns (widens) and decreases the number of rows in a data set. The data set `region_lang_top5_cities_long.csv` contains the number of Canadians reporting the primary language at home and work for five major cities (Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton). 
```{r 02-reading-long, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lang_long <- read_csv("data/region_lang_top5_cities_long.csv")
lang_long
```

What is wrong with this format above? In this example, each observation should be a language in a region. However, in the messy data set above, each observation is split across multiple rows. One where the count for `most_at_home` is recorded and the other where the count for `most_at_work` is recorded. Suppose we wanted to visualize the relationship between the number of Canadians reporting their primary language at home and work. It would be difficult to do that with the data in its current format. To fix this, we will use `pivot_wider`, and we need to specify the:

1. `data`: the data set

2. `names_from`: the name of the column from which to take the variable names

3. `values_from`: the name of the column from which to take the values

```{r , warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lang_home_tidy <- pivot_wider(lang_long,
  names_from = type,
  values_from = count
)
lang_home_tidy 
```

We can see how we transformed the data from long to wide with `pivot_wider` in Figure \@ref(fig:img-pivot-wider-table).  
```{r img-pivot-wider-table, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Going from long to wide with pivot_wider", out.width="1100", fig.retina = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/pivot_wider_table.jpeg")
```

The data above is now tidy! We can go through the three criteria again to check that this data is a tidy data set. 

1. All the variables are their own columns in the data frame, i.e., `most_at_home`, and `most_at_work` have been separated into their own columns in the data frame. 
2. Each observation, i.e., each `category`, `language`, `region`, `most_at_home` and `most_at_work`, are in a single row.
3. Each value is a single cell, i.e., its row, column position in the data frame is not shared with another value.

You might notice that we have the same number of columns in our tidy data set as we did in our messy one. Therefore `pivot_wider` didn't really "widen" our data as the name suggests. However, if we had more than two categories in the original `type` column, then we would see the data set "widen."  

### Using `separate` to deal with multiple delimiters

Data are also not considered tidy when multiple values are stored in the same cell. The data set we show below is even messier than the ones we dealt with above: the `Toronto`, `Montréal`, `Vancouver`, `Calgary` and `Edmonton` columns contain the number of Canadians reporting their primary language at home and work in one column separated by the delimiter "/". The column names are the values of a variable, AND each value does not have its own cell! To turn this messy data into tidy data, we'll have to fix these issues.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lang_messy <- read_csv("data/region_lang_top5_cities_messy.csv")
lang_messy
```

First we’ll use `pivot_longer` to create two columns, `region` and `value`, similar to what we did previously:

```{r}
lang_messy_longer <- pivot_longer(lang_messy,
  cols = Toronto:Edmonton,
  names_to = "region",
  values_to = "value"
)
lang_messy_longer
```

Then we'll use `separate` to split the `value` column into two columns, one that contains only the counts of Canadians that speak each language most at home, and one that contains the counts for most at work for each region. To use `separate` we need to specify the:

1. `data`: the data set

2. `col`: the name of a the column we need to split

3. `into`: a character vector of the new column names we would like to put the split data into

4. `sep`: the separator on which to split

```{r}
lang_no_delimiter <- separate(lang_messy_longer,
  col = value,
  into = c("most_at_home", "most_at_work"),
  sep = "/"
)
lang_no_delimiter
```


Is this data set now tidy? If we recall the three criteria for tidy data:

- each row is a single observation,
- each column is a single variable, and
- each value is a single cell.

We can see that this data now satisfies all three criteria, making it easier to analyze. However, we aren't done yet! We have a few more tasks we need to do to get this data in a more usable format, which we will see in the sections below. 

### Using `select` to extract a range of columns

Chapter 1 discussed two `tidyverse` functions: `select` and `filter` to select columns and filter rows from a data frame. We will now learn more ways we can use these functions. Recall, the `select` function creates a subset of the *columns* of a data frame, while the `filter` subsets *rows* with specific values.

We can use `select` to obtain a subset of the data frame constructed from a range of columns rather than typing each column name out. To do this, we use the colon (`:`) operator to denote the range. For example, to get all the columns in the `lang_no_delimiter` data frame from `language` to `most_at_work` we pass `language:most_at_work` as the second argument to the `select` function.

```{r}
column_range <- select(lang_no_delimiter, language:most_at_work)
column_range
```




### Using `filter` to extract rows with `==`

Recall we can use the `filter` function to obtain the subset of rows with desired values from a data frame. Again, our first argument is the name of the data frame object, `lang_no_delimiter`. The second argument is a logical statement to use when filtering the rows. Here, for example, we'll say that we are interested in rows where the category is "Official languages". We use the *equivalency operator* (`==`) to compare the values of the `category` column with the value `"Official languages"`. With these arguments, `filter` returns a data frame with all the columns of the input data frame but only the rows we asked for in our logical filter statement. 

```{r}
official_langs <- filter(lang_no_delimiter, category == "Official languages")
official_langs
```


### Using `filter` to extract rows with values above or below a threshold

```{r changing_the_units, include = FALSE}
census_popn <- 35151728
most_french <- 2669195
```

We see that `r format(most_french, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ",")` people reported speaking French in Montréal as their primary language at home. If we are interested in finding the languages in regions with higher numbers of people who speak it as their primary language at home than French in Montréal then we can create a filter to obtain rows where the value of `most_at_home` is greater than `r format(most_french, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ",")`.

```{r}
filter(official_langs, most_at_home > 2669195)
```

When we look at the table we got from `filter` above, it isn't quite doing what we'd expect. We see numbers in the table in the `most_at_home` column that are less than `r format(most_french, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ",")`. What's going on here? 

### Using `mutate` to modify columns

Notice in the table above the word `<chr>` appears beneath each of the column names. The word under the column name indicates the data type of each column. Here all of our variables are "character" data types. Recall, a character data type is a letter or a number surrounded by quotes. In the previous example in section 
\@ref(pivot-wider), the `most_at_home` and `most_at_work` variables were `<dbl>` (double) (you can verify this by looking at the tables in the previous sections), which is a numeric data type. This change is due to the delimiter "/" when we read in this messy data set. R read the columns in as character types, and it stayed that way after we separated the columns. 

Here it makes sense for `region`, `category`, and `language` to be stored as a character type. However, if we want to apply any functions that treat the `most_at_home` and `most_at_work` columns as a number (e.g. finding rows that are above a numeric threshold of a column), it won't be possible to do if the variable is stored as a `character`. R has a variety of data types, but here we will use the function `mutate` to convert these two columns to a "numeric" data type. `mutate` is a function that will allow us to create a new variable or transform existing ones in our data set. We specify the data set in the first argument, and in the proceeding arguments, we specify the function we want to apply (`as.numeric`) to which columns (`most_at_home`, `most_at_work`). Then we give the mutated variable a new name. Here we are naming the columns the same names ("most_at_home", "most_at_work"), but you can call these mutated variables anything you'd like. 

`mutate`'s general syntax is detailed in Figure \@ref(fig:img-mutate). 

```{r img-mutate, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "Syntax for the mutate function", out.width="1100", fig.retina = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mutate_function.jpeg")
```


Below we use `mutate` to convert the columns `most_at_home` and `most_at_home`
to numeric data types in the `official_langs` data set as described in figure 
\@ref(fig:img-mutate):

```{r}
official_langs <- mutate(official_langs,
  most_at_home = as.numeric(most_at_home),
  most_at_work = as.numeric(most_at_work)
)
official_langs
```
Now we see `<dbl>` appears under our columns, `most_at_home` and `most_at_work`, indicating they are double data types (which is one of the sub-types of numeric)!

Now when we filter we get what we expect: 
```{r}
filter(official_langs, most_at_home > 2669195)
```

In this case, we see that `filter` returns a data frame with only one row; this indicates that only English in Toronto is reported by more people as their primary language at home than French in Montréal.


### Using `mutate` to create new columns

```{r , include = FALSE}
census_popn <- 35151728
number_most_home <- filter(official_langs, language == "English" & region == "Toronto") |> 
  pull(most_at_home)

toronto_popn <- region_data |> filter(region == "Toronto") |> 
  pull(population) 
```


We can see in the table that `r format(number_most_home, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ",")` people reported speaking English in Toronto as their primary language at home according to the 2016 Canadian census. What does this number mean to us? To understand this number, we need context. In particular, how many people were in Toronto when this data was collected? From the 2016 Canadian census profile, the population of Toronto was reported to be `r format(toronto_popn, scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ",")` people. The number of people who report that English as their primary language at home is much more meaningful when we report it in this context. We can even go a step further and transform this count to a relative frequency or proportion. We can do this by dividing the number of people reporting a given language as their primary language at home by the number of people who live in Toronto. For example, the proportion of people who reported that their primary language at home was English in the 2016 Canadian census was `r format(round(number_most_home/toronto_popn, 2), scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ",")` in Toronto.

We can see the populations of the five cities by filtering the data
using the `%in%` operator. The `%in%` operator is used to see if an element 
belongs to a vector. Here we are filtering if any of the five cities 
("Toronto", "Montréal", "Vancouver", "Calgary", "Edmonton") match the rows in the `region`
column.
```{r}
filter(region_data, region %in% c("Toronto", "Montréal", "Vancouver", "Calgary", "Edmonton")) 
```

> **What's the difference between `==` and `%in%`?**
> Let's suppose we have two vectors, `vector1` and `vector2`. If you type 
> `vector1 == vector2` into R it
will compare the vectors element by element. R checks if the first element of 
`vector1` equals the first element of `vector2`, the second element of `vector1`
equals the second element of `vector2` etc. 
> On the other hand, `vector1 %in% vector2`
compares the first element of `vector1` to all the elements in `vector2`. 
Then the second element of `vector1` is then compared to all the elements in `vector2` etc. Notice the difference between `==` and `%in%` in the example below. 
 
```{r}
c("Vancouver", "Toronto") == c("Toronto", "Vancouver")
c("Vancouver", "Toronto") %in% c("Toronto", "Vancouver")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
city_popn <- region_data |> filter(region %in% c("Toronto", "Montréal", "Vancouver", "Calgary", "Edmonton")) |> arrange(desc(population) ) |> pull(population)
rep_popn <- rep(city_popn, 2)
```

We can create a vector of the city populations. 
Then we use `mutate` to calculate
the proportion of people reporting a given language as their primary language at home for all the languages in the `official_langs` data set by dividing the column by our vector of city populations. We give the mutated column a new name `most_at_home_proportion`, which will create a new column in our data set. 
```{r}
city_populations <- c(5928040, 4098927, 2463431, 1392609, 1321426)

official_langs <- mutate(official_langs,
                           most_at_home_proportion = most_at_home / city_populations)

official_langs
```

> Notice that we divided a vector with 10 elements (`most_at_home`) by a vector with 
only 5 elements (`city_populations`). What gives? Arithmetic operations of vectors are performed *memberwise* meaning the first element of `most_at_home` will be divided by the first element 
of `city_populations`, the second element of `most_at_home` will be divided by the second element of `city_populations` and so on. When two vectors have different lengths, the 
shorter one will be recycled to match the longer one. Here the elements of
`city_populations` will be repeated once to match the length of `most_at_home`.




### Creating a visualization with tidy data

Now that we have cleaned and wrangled our data, we can visualize how many people speak each of Canada's two 
official languages (English and French) as their primary language at home in 
these 5 regions. We can use
`ggplot` to create our data visualization. Here we create a bar chart to 
represent the proportions for each region, and colour the proportions by language. 

```{r 02-plot}
ggplot(official_langs, 
       aes(x = most_at_home_proportion, 
           y = region,
           fill = language)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  xlab("Proportion of residents reporting their primary language at home") + 
  ylab("Region")
```

> Don't worry too much about the code to make this plot, we will talk more in detail about visualizations in chapter \@ref(viz).

From this visualization, we can see that in Calgary, Edmonton, Toronto and Vancouver, English was reported as the most common primary language used at home compared to French. However, in Montréal, French was reported as the most common primary language used at home over English. 

### Notes on defining tidy data

Is there only one shape for tidy data for a given data set? Not necessarily! It depends on the statistical question you are asking and what the variables are for that question. For tidy data, each variable should be its own column. So, just as it's essential to match your statistical question with the appropriate data analysis tool (classification, clustering, hypothesis testing, etc.). It's important to match your statistical question with the appropriate variables and ensure they are represented as individual columns to make the data tidy.



## Combining functions using the pipe operator, `|>`

In R, we often have to call multiple functions in a sequence to process a data frame. The basic ways of doing this can become quickly unreadable if there are many steps. For example, suppose we need to perform three operations on
a data frame `data`:

1) add a new column `new_col` that is double another `old_col`
2) filter for rows where another column, `other_col`, is more than 5, and
3) select only the new column `new_col` for those rows.


One way of doing is to just write multiple lines of code, storing temporary objects as you go:

```{r eval = FALSE}
output_1 <- mutate(data, new_col = old_col * 2)
output_2 <- filter(output_1, other_col > 5)
output <- select(output_2, new_col)
```

This is difficult to understand for multiple reasons. The reader may be tricked into thinking the named `output_1` and `output_2`
objects are important for some reason, while they are just temporary intermediate computations. Further, the reader has to look
through and find where `output_1` and `output_2` are used in each subsequent line.

Another option for doing this would be to *compose* the functions:

```{r eval = F}
output <- select(filter(mutate(data, new_col = old_col * 2), other_col > 5), new_col)
```

Code like this can also be difficult to understand. Functions compose (reading from left to right) in the *opposite order* in which
they are computed by R (above, `mutate` happens first, then `filter`, then `select`). It is also just a really long line of code
to read in one go. 

The base R *pipe operator* `|>` solves this problem, resulting in cleaner and easier-to-follow code. The below accomplishes the same thing as the previous two code blocks:

```{r eval = F}
output <- data |> 
            mutate(new_col = old_col * 2) |>
            filter(other_col > 5) |>
            select(new_col)
```

> Note `%>%` is the previous version of the pipe operator so you may see it used 
in some textbooks or other sources. There are some drawbacks to using the `%>%` 
pipe operator, thus, in this textbook we will be using the new pipe operator syntax `|>`. 

You can think of the pipe as a physical pipe. It takes the output from the function on the left-hand side of the pipe, and
passes it as the first argument to the function on the right-hand side of the pipe. Note here that we have again split the 
code across multiple lines for readability; R is fine with this, since it knows that a line ending in a pipe `|>` is continued
on the next line. Similarly, you see that after the first pipe, the remaining 
lines are indented until the end of the pipeline. This is not required for the 
R code to work, but again is used to aid in improving code readability.

Next, let's learn about the details of using the pipe, and look at some examples of how to use it in data analysis.

### Using `|>` to combine `filter` and `select`

Let's work with our tidy `lang_home_tidy` data set from above, which contains the number of Canadians reporting their primary language at home and work for five major cities (Toronto, Montréal, Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton):
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
lang_home_tidy
```

Suppose we want to create a subset of the data with only the languages and counts of each language spoken most at home for the city of Vancouver. To do this, we can use the functions `filter` and `select`. First, we use `filter` to create a data frame called `van_data` that contains only values for Vancouver. We then use `select` on this data frame to keep only the variables we want:

```{r}
van_data <- filter(lang_home_tidy, region == "Vancouver")
van_data
van_data_selected <- select(van_data, language, most_at_home)
van_data_selected
```

Although this is valid code, there is a more readable approach we could take by using the pipe, `|>`. With the pipe, we do not need to create an intermediate object to store the output from `filter`. Instead we can directly send the 
output of `filter` to the input of `select`:

```{r}
van_data_selected <- filter(lang_home_tidy, region == "Vancouver") |>
  select(language, most_at_home)
van_data_selected
```

But wait - why does our `select` function call look different in these two examples? When you use the pipe, 
the output of the function on the left is automatically provided as the first argument for the function on the right, and thus you do not specify that argument in that function call. In the code above, the first
argument of `select` is the data frame we are `select`-ing from, which is provided by the output of `filter`. 

As you can see, both of these approaches give us the same output, but the second approach is more clear and readable.

### Using `|>` with more than two functions

The `|>` can be used with any function in R. Additionally, we can pipe together more than two functions. For example, we can pipe together three functions to order the rows by counts of the language most spoken at home for only the counts that are more than 10,000 and only include the region, language and count of Canadians reporting their primary language at home in our table. 

To order by counts of the language most spoken at home we will use the 
`tidyverse` function, `arrange`. Recall this function takes column names as input and 
orders the rows in the data frame in ascending order based on the values in the 
columns. Here we use only one column for sorting (`most_at_home`), but more than 
one can also be used. To do this, list additional columns separated by commas. 
The order they are listed in indicates the order in which they will be used for 
sorting. This is much like how an English dictionary sorts words: first by the 
first letter, then by the second letter, and so on. *Remember: If you want to sort 
in reverse order, you can pair a function called `desc` with `arrange` (e.g., 
`arrange(desc(column_name))`).*


```{r}
large_region_lang <- filter(lang_home_tidy, most_at_home > 10000) |>
  select(region, language, most_at_home) |>
  arrange(most_at_home)
large_region_lang
```

> **Note:** You might also have noticed that we split the function calls across lines after the pipe, similar as to 
> when we did this earlier in the chapter for long function calls. Again this is allowed and recommeded, especially when the 
> piped function calls would create a long line of code. Doing this makes your code more readable. When you do this it is important 
> to end each line with the pipe operator `|>` to tell R that your code is continuing onto the next line. 

## Iterating over data with `group_by` + `summarize`

### Calculating summary statistics:

As a part of many data analyses, we need to calculate a summary value for the data (a summary statistic). A useful `dplyr` function for doing this is 
`summarize`. Examples of summary statistics we might want to calculate are the number of observations, the average/mean value 
for a column, the minimum value for a column, etc. Below we show how to use the `summarize` function to calculate the minimum and maximum 
number of Canadians reporting a particular language as their primary language at home:

```{r}
lang_summary <- summarize(lang_home_tidy,
  min_most_at_home = min(most_at_home),
  most_most_at_home = max(most_at_home)
)
lang_summary
```

From this we see that there are some languages in the data set the no one speaks
as their primary language at home, as well as that the most commonly spoken 
primary language at home is spoken by  `r format(lang_summary$most_most_at_home[1], scientific = FALSE, big.mark = ",")` 
people.

### Calculating group summary statistics:

A common pairing with `summarize` is `group_by`. Pairing these functions together can let you summarize values for subgroups within a data set. For example, here, we can use `group_by` to group the regions and then calculate the minimum and maximum number of Canadians reporting the language as the primary language at home for each of the groups.

The `group_by` function takes at least two arguments. The first is the data frame that will be grouped, and the second and onwards are columns to use in the grouping. Here we use only one column for grouping (`region`), but more than one can also be used. To do this, list additional columns separated by commas. 

```{r}
lang_summary_by_region <- group_by(lang_home_tidy, region) |>
  summarize(
    min_most_at_home = min(most_at_home),
    max_most_at_home = max(most_at_home)
  )
lang_summary_by_region
```

### Additional reading on the `dplyr` functions

As we briefly mentioned earlier in a note, the `tidyverse` is actually a *meta R package*: it installs and loads a collection of R packages that all follow 
the tidy data philosophy we discussed above. One of the `tidyverse` packages is `dplyr` - a data wrangling workhorse. You have already met six of 
the dplyr function (`select`, `filter`, `mutate`, `arrange`, `summarize`, and `group_by`). To learn more about those six and meet a few more 
useful functions, we recommend you checkout [this chapter](http://stat545.com/block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html#where-were-we) of the Stat 545 book.


## Using `purrr`'s `map*` functions to iterate

Where should you turn when you discover the next step in your data wrangling/cleaning process requires you to apply a function to 
each column in a data frame? For example, if you wanted to know the maximum value of each column in a data frame? Well, you could use `summarize` 
as discussed above. However, this becomes inconvenient when you have many columns, as `summarize` requires you to type out a column name and a data 
transformation for each summary statistic you want to calculate.

In cases like this, where you want to apply the same data transformation to all columns, it is more efficient to use `purrr`'s `map` function to 
apply it to each column. For example, let's find the maximum value of each column of the complete `region_lang` data frame by using `map` with the `max` function. First, let’s peak at the data to familiarize ourselves with it:
```{r 02-preview-data}
region_lang <- read_csv("data/region_lang.csv")
region_lang
```
Next, we will select only the numeric columns of the data frame:

```{r 02-numeric-data}
region_lang_numeric <- region_lang |>
  select(mother_tongue:lang_known)
region_lang_numeric
```
Next, we use `map` to apply the `max` function to each column. `map` takes two arguments, an object (a vector, data frame or list) that you want 
to apply the function to, and the function that you would like to apply. Here our arguments will be `region_lang_numeric` and `max`:

```{r 02-map}
max_of_columns <- map(region_lang_numeric, max)
max_of_columns
```

> **Note:** `purrr` is part of the tidyverse, and so like the `dplyr` and `ggplot` functions, once we call `library(tidyverse)` we 
> do not need to load the `purrr` package separately.

Our output looks a bit weird... we passed in a data frame, but our output doesn't look like a data frame. As it so happens, it is *not* a 
data frame, but rather a plain vanilla list:

```{r 02-type-out-of-map}
typeof(max_of_columns)
```

So what do we do? Should we convert this to a data frame? We could, but a simpler alternative is to just use a different `map_*` function from 
the `purrr` package. There are quite a few to choose from, they all work similarly, and their name reflects the type of output you want from 
the mapping operation:

| `map` function | Output |
|----------|--------|
| `map()` | list |
| `map_lgl()` | logical vector |
| `map_int()` | integer vector |
| `map_dbl()` | double vector |
| `map_chr()` | character vector |
| `map_df()` | data frame |

Let's get the columns' maximums again, but this time use the `map_df` function to return the output as a data frame:

```{r 02-map-df-example}
max_of_columns <- map_df(region_lang_numeric, max)
max_of_columns
```

Which `map_*` function you choose depends on what you want to do with the output; you don't always have to pick `map_df`!

What if you need to add other arguments to the functions you want to map? For example, what if there were NA values in our columns that we wanted to know the maximum of? 

```{r 02-making-NAs, include = F}
region_with_nas <- region_lang_numeric |>
  add_row(mother_tongue = 5, most_at_home = 5, most_at_work = NA, lang_known = NA) |>
  arrange(!is.na(lang_known), lang_known) |>
  write_csv("data/region_lang_with_nas.csv")
```

```{r 02-read-in-na}
region_with_nas <- read_csv("data/region_lang_with_nas.csv")
region_with_nas
map_df(region_with_nas, max)
```
Notice `map_df()` returns `NA` for the `most_at_work` and `lang_known` variables since those columns contained NAs in the data frame. Thus, we also need to add the argument `na.rm  = TRUE` to the `max` function so that we get a more useful value than `NA` returned (remember that is what happens with many of the built-in R statistical functions when NA's are present...). What we need to do in that case is add these additional arguments to the end of our call to to `map` and they will be passed to the function that we are mapping. An example of this is shown below:

```{r}
map_df(region_with_nas, max, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Now `map_df()` returns the maximum count for each column ignoring the NAs in the data set! 

The `map_*` functions are generally quite useful for solving problems involving iteration/repetition. Additionally, their use is not limited to columns 
of a data frame; `map_*` functions can be used to apply functions to elements of a vector or list, and even to lists of data frames, or nested data frames.

## Additional resources
- The [`dplyr` page on the tidyverse website](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) is where you should look if you want to learn more about the functions in this chapter, the full set of arguments you can use, and other related functions. The site also provides a very nice cheat sheet that summarizes many of the data wrangling functions from this chapter.
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) has a few chapters related to data wrangling that go into more depth than this book. For example, the [tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) chapter covers tidy data, `pivot_longer`/`pivot_wider` and `separate`, but also covers missing values and additional wrangling functions (like `unite`). The [data transformation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) chapter covers `select`, `filter`, `arrange`, `mutate`, and `summarize`. And the [`map_*` functions](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions) chapter provides more about the `map_*` functions.
- You will occasionally encounter a case where you need to iterate over items in a data frame, but none of the above functions are flexible enough to do what you want. In that case, you may consider using [a for loop](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#iteration).
