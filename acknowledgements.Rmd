# Acknowledgments {-}

We'd like to thank everyone that has contributed to the development of 
[*Data Science: A First Introduction*](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/). 
This is an open source textbook that began as a collection of course readings
for a new introductory data science course 
at the University of British Columbia (UBC), DSCI 100.
Several faculty members in the UBC Department of Statistics 
were pivotal in shaping the direction of that course, 
and as such contributed greatly to the shape and direction of this book. 
We would especially like to thank Matías Salibían-Barrera 
for his great mentoring during the roll out of this course 
and book in the early days.
His door was always open to chat about how to best introduce 
and teach data science our first year students.

Much acknowledgements 
and thanks to shaping this book goes to the DSCI 100 students.
Their enthusiasm to learn data science sustained us during the hard work 
of creating a new course and writing a textbook.
Their patience when they uncovered bugs in the book was much needed.
Their feedback on the book and the course, 
really has contributed to making the book what it is today.
