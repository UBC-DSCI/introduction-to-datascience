## Overview

To be able to effectively and efficiently write R code for your analysis you 
will need access to the R programming language on a computer. This chapter will 
show you how to use the R programming language with a common coding 
platform in data science, Jupyter. In this chapter, we will show you how to use this platform via a web-interface for ease of getting going 
quickly. In a later chapter, we will also show you how to install and configure this on your local computer (i.e., laptop). These skills are essential to getting your analysis running; think of it like getting dressed in the morning!

## Chapter learning objectives

By the end of the chapter, students will be able to:

- use Jupyter to run, edit and write R code
- open and view plain text data files in Jupyter
- create new Jupyter notebooks
- export Jupyter notebooks to other standard file types (e.g., `.html`, `.pdf`)

## Jupyter

Jupyter is a web-based interactive development environment for creating, editing and executing documents called Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks are documents that contain a mix of computer code (and its output) and formattable text. Given that they combine these two analysis artifacts in a single document—code is not separate from the output or written report—notebooks are one of the leading tools to create reproducible data analyses. Reproducible data analysis is one where you can reliably and easily recreate the same results when analyzing the same data. Although this sounds like something that should always be true of any data analysis, in reality, this is not often the case; one needs to make a conscious effort to perform data analysis in a reproducible manner.

The name Jupyter came from combining the names of the three programming languages that it was initially targeted for (Julia, Python, and R), and now many other languages can be used with Jupyter notebooks.

An example of what a Jupyter notebook looks like is shown in \@ref(fig:img-jupyter).

```{r img-jupyter, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "A screenshot of a Jupyter Notebook.", fig.retina = 2}
knitr::include_graphics("img/jupyter.png")
```

### Accessing Jupyter

One of the easiest ways to start computing in R with Jupyter is to use a 
web-based platform called JupyterHub that already has Jupyter, R, a number of R packages, and collaboration tools installed, configured and ready to use. 
JupyterHub's are usually created and provisioned by organizations (for example,
a university, a company, *etcetera*) and require authentication to gain 
access. <!--- Insert link to public JupyterHub here if we can get 
access/permission (either 2i2c collaboration, or 
https://notebooks.gesis.org/hub/home) --> Jupyter can also be installed on your
own computer (desktop or laptop), and we provide examples of how to do this in
chapter \@ref(move-to-your-own-machine).

## Code cells

The sections of a Jupyter notebook that contain code in the R programming 
language are referred to as code cells. A code cell that has not yet been executed 
has no number inside the square brackets to the left of the cell 
(Figure \@ref(fig:code-cell-not-run)). Running a code cell will execute all of 
the code it contains, and the output (if any exists) will be displayed directly
underneath the code that generated it. Outputs may include printed text or 
numbers, data frames and data visualizations. Cells that have been executed 
also have a number inside the square brackets to the left of the cell. 
This number indicates the order in which the cells were run 
(Figure \@ref(fig:code-cell-run)).

```{r code-cell-not-run, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A code cell in Jupyter that has not yet been executed.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/code-cell-not-run.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x1000")
```

```{r code-cell-run, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A code cell in Jupyter that has been executed.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/code-cell-run.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x2000")
```


### Executing code cells

Code cells can be run independently or as part of executing the entire notebook 
using one of the "**Run all**" commands found in the **Run** or **Kernel** menus 
in Jupyter. Running a single code cell independently is a workflow typically 
used when editing or writing your own R code. Executing an entire notebook is a 
workflow typically used to ensure that your analysis runs in its entirety before 
sharing it with others, and when using a notebook as part of an automated 
process.

To run the a code cell independently, the cell needs to first be activated. This
is done by clicking on it with the cursor. Jupyter will indicate a cell has been
activated by highlighting it with a blue rectangle to its left. After the cell
has been activated, the cell can be run by either pressing the **Run** (▶) 
button in the Jupyter notebook tab menu, or by using a keyboard shortcut of 
`Shift + Enter`.

```{r activate-and-run-button, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "An activated cell that is ready to be be run. The red arrow points to blue rectangle to the cell's left. The blue rectangle indicates that it is ready to be run. This can be done by clicking the run button (circled in red).", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/activate-and-run-button-annotated.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

To execute all of the code cells in an entire notebook, you can either select:

1. **Run** >> **Run All Cells**

2. **Kernel** >> **Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...** from the Jupyter menu

3. Click the **Restart the kernel, then re-run the whole notebook** button (▶▶) 
in the Jupyter notebook tab menu. 

All of these commands result in all of the code cells in a notebook being run, 
however only the **Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...** command and the ▶▶ 
button will restart the R session before running all of the cells. Restarting 
the R session before running all of the cells means that all previous objects 
that were created from running cells before this command was run will be 
deleted. This command emulates how your notebook code would run if you 
completely restarted Jupyter before executing your entire notebook.

```{r restart-kernel-run-all, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Restarting the R session can be accomplished by clicking Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/restart-kernel-run-all.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

> #### The Kernel
> The kernel is a program that executes the code inside your notebook and outputs
> the results. Kernels for many different programming languages have been 
> created for Jupyter, which means that Jupyter can interpret and execute the 
> code of many different programming languages. To run R code, your notebook 
> will need an R kernel. In the top right of your window, you can see a circle 
> that indicates the status of your kernel. If the circle is empty (⚪), 
> the kernel is idle and ready to execute code. If the circle is filled in (⚫), 
> the kernel is busy running some code.
> 
> You may run into problems where your kernel is stuck for an excessive amount 
> of time, your notebook is very slow and unresponsive, or your kernel loses its
> connection. If this happens, try the following steps:
>
> - At the top of your screen, click **Kernel**, then **Interrupt Kernel**.
> - If that doesn't help, click **Kernel**, then **Restart Kernel**.... If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.
> - If that doesn't help, restart your server. First, save your work by clicking **File** at the top left of your screen, then **Save Notebook**. Next, from the **File** menu click **Hub Control Panel**. Choose **Stop My Server** to shut it down, then the **My Server** button to start it back up. Then, navigate back to the notebook you were working on.

### Creating new code cells

To create a new code cell in Jupyter, click the `+` button in the Jupyter notebook tab menu. By default, all new cells in Jupyter start out as code cells, so after this, all you have to do is write R code within the new cell you just created!

```{r create-new-code-cell, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "New cells can be created by clicking the + button, and are by default code cells.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/create-new-code-cell.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

## Markdown cells

Text cells inside a Jupyter notebook are called Markdown cells. Markdown cells 
are rich formatted text cells, which means you can **bold** and *italicize* 
text, create subject headers, format bullet and numbered lists. These cells are 
given the name "Markdown" because they use the Markdown markup language to 
specify the rich text formatting. A markup language is a human readable computer 
language for specifying how plain text should be richly formatted by the program
that renders it.

You do not need to learn Markdown to write text in the Markdown cells in 
Jupyter, plain text will work just fine. However, you might want to learn a bit 
about the Markdown markup language eventually. Teaching the markdown formatting 
language is beyond the scope of this book. However, If you are keen to learn 
more, a good place to start is this cheatsheet by Commonmark: 
[https://commonmark.org/help/](https://commonmark.org/help/), 
as well as their tutorial: 
[https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

### Editing Markdown cells

To edit a Markdown cell in Jupyter, you need to double click on any Markdown 
cell and the unformatted (we call this unrendered) version of the text will be
shown. You can then use your keyboard to edit the text. To view the formatted
(we call this rendered) text, click the **Run** (▶) button in the Jupyter 
notebook tab menu, or use the `Shift + Enter` keyboard shortcut.

```{r markdown-cell-not-run, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A Markdown cell in Jupyter that has not yet been rendered and can be edited.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/markdown-cell-not-run.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

```{r markdown-cell-run, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A Markdown cell in Jupyter that has been rendered and exhibits rich text formatting. ", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/markdown-cell-run.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

### Creating new Markdown cells

To create a new Markdown cell in Jupyter, click the `+` button in the Jupyter 
notebook tab menu. By default, all new cells in Jupyter start as code cells, so the cell format needs to be changed to be recognized and rendered as a Markdown cell. To do this, click on the cell with your cursor to 
ensure it is activated, and then click on the drop-down box next to the 
**Restart the kernel, then re-run the whole notebook** button (▶▶) in the 
Jupyter notebook tab menu and changing it from "**Code**" to "**Markdown**".

```{r convert-to-markdown-cell, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "New cells are by default code cells. To create Markdown cells, the cell format must be changed.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/convert-to-markdown-cell.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

## Saving your work

As with any file you work on, it is critical to save your work often so you 
don't lose your progress! Jupyter has an autosave feature, where open files are 
saved periodically. The default for this is every two minutes. You can also 
manually save a Jupyter notebook by selecting **Save Notebook** from the 
File menu, by clicking the dick icon on the tab menu of the Jupyter notebook,
or by using a keyboard shortcut (`Control + S` for Windows, or `Command + S` for
Mac OS). 

## Best practices for running a notebook

### Best practices for executing code cells

As you might know (or at least imagine) by now, Jupyter notebooks are great for
interactively editing, writing and running R code - this is what they were 
designed for. Consequently, Jupyter notebooks are flexible in regards to code 
cell execution order. This flexibility means that code cells can be run in any 
arbitrary order using the **Run** (▶) button. This flexibility has a downside 
since it can lead to Jupyter notebooks whose code cannot be executed in a linear 
order (from top to bottom of the notebook). A non-linear notebook is problematic 
because a linear order is the conventional way code documents are run, and 
others will have this expectation when running your notebook. Finally, if the 
code is used in some automated process, it will need to run in a linear order, 
from top to bottom of the notebook.

Even with the best intentions, the flexibility of a Jupyter notebook can 
sometimes cause us to misstep and write non-linear code. This misstep is most 
often due to relying solely on using the ▶ button to execute cells. For example, 
suppose you write some R code that creates an R object, say a variable named 
`y`. When you execute that cell and create `y`, it will continue 
to exist until it is deliberately deleted with R code, or when the Jupyter 
notebook R session (*i.e.*, kernel) is stopped or restarted. It can also be 
referenced in another distinct code cell. Together, this means that you could then write 
a code cell further above in the notebook that references `y` and execute 
it without error in the current session. This could also be done successfully in 
future sessions if, and only if, you run the cells in the same non-conventional 
order. However, it is difficult to remember this non-conventional order, and it 
is not the order that others would expect your code to be executed in. An 
example of this scenario is shown in figures 
\@ref(fig:out-of-order-1) - \@ref(fig:out-of-order-3).

Another thing that the flexibility of a Jupyter notebooks allows you to do is create 
objects through running a cell, which later gets deleted. In such a scenario, that 
object only exists for that one particular R session and would not exist again 
if the notebook session was restarted and the notebook run again. If that 
object was referenced in another cell in that notebook, an error would likely
occur when the Jupyter notebook was run again in a new session.

```{r out-of-order-1, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Code that was written out of order, but not yet executed.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/out-of-order-1.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x800")
```

```{r out-of-order-2, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Code that was written out of order, and was executed using the run button in a non-linear error without error. The order of execution can be traced by following the numbers to the left of the code cells; their order indicates the order in which the cells were executed.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/out-of-order-2.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x800")
```

```{r out-of-order-3, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Code that was written out of order, and was executed in a linear order using "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells..." This resulted in an error at the execution of the second code cell and it failed to run all code cells in the notebook.', fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/out-of-order-3.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x800")
```

These events may not negatively affect the current R session when 
the code was being written, but as you might now see, they will likely lead to 
errors when that notebook is run in a future session. Regularly, and 
intentionally executing the entire notebook in a fresh R session will help guard 
against this by letting a user know that some aspect of the code does not allow 
the notebook to be run linearly. Knowing this sooner than later will allow the 
user to fix the issue quickly and easily, ideally within that session. We 
recommend doing this at least 2-3 times within any work session on a Jupyter 
notebook.

Note that a key thing about our best practice recommendation here is not just
running all the cells, but also doing this in a fresh R session. To do this in 
Jupyter, we recommend using either the **Kernel** >> 
**Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...** command from the Jupyter menu or the ▶▶ 
button in the Jupyter notebook tab menu. The **Run** >> **Run All Cells** 
command from the Jupyter menu will run all the cells, but it will not do this 
a fresh R session, and so it is not sufficient to guard against these errors.

### Best practices for including R packages in notebooks



Most data analyses these days depend on functions from external R packages that are not built-in to R. One example is the `tidyverse` metapackage that we heavily rely on in this book. This package provides us access to functions like `read_csv` for reading data, `select` for subsetting columns, and `ggplot` for creating high-quality graphics. 

As mentioned earlier in the book, external R packages need to be loaded before the functions they contain can be used. Our recommended way to do this is via `library(package_name)`. But where should this line of code be written in a Jupyter notebook? One idea could be to load the library right before the function is used in the notebook. However, although this technically works, this causes hidden, or at least non-obvious, R package dependencies when others view or try to run the notebook. These hidden dependencies can lead to errors when the notebook is executed on another computer if the needed R packages are not installed. Additionally, if the data analysis code takes a long time to run, uncovering the hidden dependencies that need to be installed so that the analysis can run without error can take a great deal of time to uncover.

Therefore, we recommend you load all R packages in a code cell near the top of the Jupyter notebook. Loading all your packages at the start ensures that all packages are loaded before their functions are called (assuming the notebook is run in a linear order from top to bottom, as recommended above) and makes it easy for others viewing or running the notebook to see what external R packages were used in the analysis, and hence, what packages they should install on their computer to run the analysis successfully.

### Summary of best practices for running a notebook

1. Write code so that it can be executed in a linear order.

2. As you write code in a Jupyter notebook, run the notebook in a linear order 
and in it's entirety often (2-3 times every work session) via the **Kernel** >> 
**Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...** command from the Jupyter menu or the ▶▶ 
button in the Jupyter notebook tab menu.

3. Write the code that loads external R packages near the top of the Jupyter 
notebook.

## Exploring data files

It is essential to preview data files before you try to read them into R to see whether or not there are column names, what the delimiters are, and if there are lines you need to skip. In Jupyter, you preview data files stored as plain text files (e.g., comma- and tab-separated files) in their plain text format by right-clicking on the file's name in the Jupyter file explorer and selecting **Open with** and then selecting **Editor**. Suppose you do not specify to open the data file with an editor. In that case, Jupyter will render a nice table for you, and you will not be able to see the column delimiters, and therefore you will not know which function to use, nor which arguments to use and values to specify for them.

```{r open-data-w-editor-01, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Opening data files with an editor in Jupyter.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/open_data_w_editor_01.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x2000")
```

```{r open-data-w-editor-02, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A data file as viewed in an editor in Jupyter.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/open_data_w_editor_02.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x2000")
```

## Exporting to a different file format 

In Jupyter, viewing, editing and running R code is done in the Jupyter notebook (file extension `.ipynb`) file format. This file format is not easy to open and view outside of Jupyter. Thus, to share your analysis with people who do not commonly use Jupyter, it is recommended that you export your executed analysis as a more common file type, such as an `.html` file, or a `.pdf`. We recommend exporting the Jupyter notebook after executing the analysis so that you can also share the outputs of your code.

The `.html` file format will result in a shareable file that anyone can open using a web browser (*e.g.,* Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Edge, *etc.*). It will result in a document that is visually similar to what the Jupyter notebook looked like inside Jupyter. One point of caution here is that if there are images in your Jupyter notebook, you will need to share the image files and the `.html` file to see them.

The `.pdf` file format will result in a shareable file that anyone can open using many programs, including Adobe Acrobat, Preview, web browsers and many more. The benefit of exporting to PDF is that it is a standalone document, even if the Jupyter notebook included references to image files. The conventional route for exporting Jupyter notebooks to `.pdf` files depends on a powerful tool called LaTeX. The default settings will result in a document that visually looks quite different from what the Jupyter notebook looked like inside Jupyter regarding font and page margins. The formatting can be customized, however, this requires some learning of the LaTeX markup language. 

## Creating a new Jupyter notebook

At some point, you will want to create a new, fresh Jupyter notebook for your own project instead of viewing, running or editing a notebook that was started by someone else. To do this, navigate to the **Launcher** tab, and click on the R icon under the **Notebook** heading. If no **Launcher** tab is visible, you can get a new one via clicking the **+** button at the top of the Jupyter file explorer. 

```{r launcher, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Clicking on the R icon under the Notebook heading will create a new Jupyter notebook with an R kernel.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/launcher-annotated.png") %>% 
  image_crop("3632x2000")
```


Once you have created a new Jupyter notebook, be sure to give it a descriptive name, as the default file name is `Untitle.ipynb`. You can rename files by right-clicking on the file name of the Jupyter notebook you just created and click **Rename**. This will make the file name editable. Use your keyboard to change the name. Pressing `Enter` or clicking anywhere else in the Jupyter the interface will save the changed file name.

We recommend not using white space or non-standard characters in file names. 
Doing so will not prevent you from using that file in Jupyter. However, these sorts of things become troublesome as you start to do more advanced data science projects that involve repetition and automation. We recommend naming files using lower case characters and separating words by a dash (`-`) or an underscore (`_`).
