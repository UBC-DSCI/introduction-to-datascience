## Overview

A typical data analysis involves not only writing and executing code, but also writing text and displaying images
that help tell the story of the analysis. In fact, ideally, we would like to *interleave* these three media,
with the text and images serving as narration for the code and its output.
In this chapter we will show you how to accomplish this using Jupyter notebooks, a common coding platform in 
data science. Jupyter notebooks do precisely what we need: they let you combine text, images, and (executable!) code in a single
document. In this chapter, we will focus on the *use* of Jupyter notebooks to program in R and write
text via a web-interface. 
These skills are essential to getting your analysis running; think of it like getting dressed in the morning!
Note that we assume that you already have Jupyter set up and ready to use. If that is not the case, please first read
Chapter \@ref(move-to-your-own-machine) to learn how to install and configure Jupyter on your own
computer. 

## Chapter learning objectives

By the end of the chapter, readers will be able to:

- create new Jupyter notebooks
- write, edit, and execute R code in a Jupyter notebook
- write, edit, and view text in a Jupyter notebook
- open and view plain text data files in Jupyter
- export Jupyter notebooks to other standard file types (e.g., `.html`, `.pdf`)

## Jupyter

Jupyter is a web-based interactive development environment for creating, editing, 
and executing documents called Jupyter notebooks. Jupyter notebooks \index{Jupyter notebook} are 
documents that contain a mix of computer code (and its output) and formattable 
text. Given that they combine these two analysis artifacts in a single 
document&mdash;code is not separate from the output or written report&mdash;notebooks are 
one of the leading tools to create reproducible data analyses. Reproducible data 
analysis \index{reproducible} is one where you can reliably and easily recreate the same results when 
analyzing the same data. Although this sounds like something that should always 
be true of any data analysis, in reality, this is not often the case; one needs 
to make a conscious effort to perform data analysis in a reproducible manner.
An example of what a Jupyter notebook looks like is shown in 
Figure \@ref(fig:img-jupyter).

```{r img-jupyter, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.cap = "A screenshot of a Jupyter Notebook.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/jupyter.png")
```

### Accessing Jupyter

One of the easiest ways to start working with Jupyter is to use a 
web-based platform called \index{JupyterHub} JupyterHub. JupyterHubs often have Jupyter, R, a number of R 
packages, and collaboration tools installed, configured and ready to use. 
JupyterHubs are usually created and provisioned by organizations,
and require authentication to gain access. For example, if you are reading
this book as part of a course, your instructor may have a JupyterHub
already set up for you to use! <!--- Insert link to public JupyterHub here if we can get 
access/permission (either 2i2c collaboration, or 
https://notebooks.gesis.org/hub/home) --> Jupyter can also be installed on your
own computer; see Chapter \@ref(move-to-your-own-machine) for instructions.

## Code cells

The sections of a Jupyter notebook that contain code are referred to as code cells. 
A code cell \index{Jupyter notebook!code cell} that has not yet been 
executed has no number inside the square brackets to the left of the cell 
(Figure \@ref(fig:code-cell-not-run)). Running a code cell will execute all of 
the code it contains, and the output (if any exists) will be displayed directly
underneath the code that generated it. Outputs may include printed text or 
numbers, data frames and data visualizations. Cells that have been executed 
also have a number inside the square brackets to the left of the cell. 
This number indicates the order in which the cells were run 
(Figure \@ref(fig:code-cell-run)).

```{r code-cell-not-run, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A code cell in Jupyter that has not yet been executed.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/code-cell-not-run.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x1000")
```

```{r code-cell-run, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A code cell in Jupyter that has been executed.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/code-cell-run.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x2000")
```


### Executing code cells

Code cells \index{Jupyter notebook!cell execution} can be run independently or as part of executing the entire notebook 
using one of the "**Run all**" commands found in the **Run** or **Kernel** menus 
in Jupyter. Running a single code cell independently is a workflow typically 
used when editing or writing your own R code. Executing an entire notebook is a 
workflow typically used to ensure that your analysis runs in its entirety before 
sharing it with others, and when using a notebook as part of an automated 
process.

To run the a code cell independently, the cell needs to first be activated. This
is done by clicking on it with the cursor. Jupyter will indicate a cell has been
activated by highlighting it with a blue rectangle to its left. After the cell
has been activated (Figure \@ref(fig:activate-and-run-button)), the cell can be run by either pressing the **Run** (▶) 
button in the toolbar, or by using a keyboard shortcut of 
`Shift + Enter`.

```{r activate-and-run-button, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "An activated cell that is ready to be run. The red arrow points to the blue rectangle to the cell's left. The blue rectangle indicates that it is ready to be run. This can be done by clicking the run button (circled in red).", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/activate-and-run-button-annotated.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

To execute all of the code cells in an entire notebook, you have three options:

1. Select **Run** >> **Run All Cells** from the menu.

2. Select **Kernel** >> **Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...** from the menu (Figure \@ref(fig:restart-kernel-run-all)).

3. Click the (▶▶) button in the tool bar.

All of these commands result in all of the code cells in a notebook being run.
However, there is a slight difference between them.  In particular, only
options 2 and 3 above will restart the R session before running all of the
cells; option 1 will not restart the session. Restarting the R session means
that all previous objects that were created from running cells before this
command was run will be deleted. In other words, restarting the session and
then running all cells (options 2 or 3) emulates how your notebook code would
run if you completely restarted Jupyter before executing your entire notebook.

```{r restart-kernel-run-all, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Restarting the R session can be accomplished by clicking Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/restart-kernel-run-all.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

### The Kernel
The kernel \index{kernel}\index{Jupyter notebook!kernel|see{kernel}} is a program that executes the code inside your notebook and 
outputs the results. Kernels for many different programming languages have 
been created for Jupyter, which means that Jupyter can interpret and execute 
the code of many different programming languages. To run R code, your notebook 
will need an R kernel. In the top right of your window, you can see a circle 
that indicates the status of your kernel. If the circle is empty (⚪), 
the kernel is idle and ready to execute code. If the circle is filled in (⚫), 
the kernel is busy running some code.

You may run into problems where your kernel \index{kernel!interrupt,restart} is stuck for an excessive amount 
of time, your notebook is very slow and unresponsive, or your kernel loses its
connection. If this happens, try the following steps:

1. At the top of your screen, click **Kernel**, then **Interrupt Kernel**.
2. If that doesn't help, click **Kernel**, then **Restart Kernel...** If you do this, you will have to run your code cells from the start of your notebook up until where you paused your work.
3. If that still doesn't help, restart Jupyter. First, save your work by clicking **File** at the top left of your screen, then **Save Notebook**. Next, if you are accessing Jupyter using a JupyterHub server, from the **File** menu click **Hub Control Panel**. Choose **Stop My Server** to shut it down, then the **My Server** button to start it back up. If you are running Jupyter on your own computer, from the **File** menu click **Shut Down**, then start Jupyter again. Finally, navigate back to the notebook you were working on.

### Creating new code cells

To create a new code cell in Jupyter (Figure \@ref(fig:create-new-code-cell)), click the `+` button in the 
toolbar. By default, all new cells in Jupyter start out as code cells, 
so after this, all you have to do is write R code within the new cell you just 
created!

```{r create-new-code-cell, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "New cells can be created by clicking the + button, and are by default code cells.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/create-new-code-cell.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

## Markdown cells

Text cells inside a Jupyter notebook are \index{markdown} \index{Jupyter notebook!markdown cell} called Markdown cells. Markdown cells 
are rich formatted text cells, which means you can **bold** and *italicize* 
text, create subject headers, create bullet and numbered lists, and more. These cells are 
given the name "Markdown" because they use *Markdown language* to specify the rich text formatting.
You do not need to learn Markdown to write text in the Markdown cells in 
Jupyter; plain text will work just fine. However, you might want to learn a bit 
about Markdown eventually to enable you to create nicely formatted analyses. 
See the additional resources at the end of this chapter to find out
where you can start learning Markdown.

### Editing Markdown cells

To edit a Markdown cell in Jupyter, you need to double click on the cell. Once
you do this,  the unformatted (or *unrendered*) version of the text will be
shown (Figure \@ref(fig:markdown-cell-not-run)). You 
can then use your keyboard to edit the text. To view the formatted
(or *rendered*) text (Figure \@ref(fig:markdown-cell-run)), click the **Run** (▶) button in the toolbar, 
or use the `Shift + Enter` keyboard shortcut.

```{r markdown-cell-not-run, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A Markdown cell in Jupyter that has not yet been rendered and can be edited.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/markdown-cell-not-run.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

```{r markdown-cell-run, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A Markdown cell in Jupyter that has been rendered and exhibits rich text formatting. ", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/markdown-cell-run.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

### Creating new Markdown cells

To create a new Markdown cell in Jupyter, click the `+` button in the toolbar. 
By default, all new cells in Jupyter start as code cells, so 
the cell format needs to be changed to be recognized and rendered as a Markdown 
cell. To do this, click on the cell with your cursor to 
ensure it is activated.  Then click on the drop-down box on the toolbar that says "Code" (it
is next to the ▶▶ button), and change it from "**Code**" to "**Markdown**" (Figure \@ref(fig:convert-to-markdown-cell)).

```{r convert-to-markdown-cell, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "New cells are by default code cells. To create Markdown cells, the cell format must be changed.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/convert-to-markdown-cell.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x900")
```

## Saving your work

As with any file you work on, it is critical to save your work often so you 
don't lose your progress! Jupyter has an autosave feature, where open files are 
saved periodically. The default for this is every two minutes. You can also 
manually save a Jupyter notebook by selecting **Save Notebook** from the 
**File** menu, by clicking the disk icon on the toolbar,
or by using a keyboard shortcut (`Control + S` for Windows, or `Command + S` for
Mac OS). 

## Best practices for running a notebook

### Best practices for executing code cells

As you might know (or at least imagine) by now, Jupyter notebooks are great for
interactively editing, writing and running R code; this is what they were 
designed for! Consequently, Jupyter notebooks are flexible in regards to code 
cell execution order. This flexibility means that code cells can be run in any 
arbitrary order using the **Run** (▶) button. But this flexibility has a downside: 
it can lead to Jupyter notebooks whose code cannot be executed in a linear 
order (from top to bottom of the notebook). A nonlinear notebook is problematic 
because a linear order is the conventional way code documents are run, and 
others will have this expectation when running your notebook. Finally, if the 
code is used in some automated process, it will need to run in a linear order, 
from top to bottom of the notebook. \index{Jupyter notebook!best practices}

The most common way to inadvertently create a nonlinear notebook is to rely solely 
on using the ▶ button to execute cells. For example, 
suppose you write some R code that creates an R object, say a variable named 
`y`. When you execute that cell and create `y`, it will continue 
to exist until it is deliberately deleted with R code, or when the Jupyter 
notebook R session (*i.e.*, kernel) is stopped or restarted. It can also be 
referenced in another distinct code cell (Figure \@ref(fig:out-of-order-1)). 
Together, this means that you could then write a code cell further above in the
notebook that references `y` and execute it without error in the current session 
(Figure \@ref(fig:out-of-order-2)). This could also be done successfully in 
future sessions if, and only if, you run the cells in the same non-conventional 
order. However, it is difficult to remember this non-conventional order, and it 
is not the order that others would expect your code to be executed in. Thus in 
future this would lead to errors when the notebook is run in the conventional 
linear order (Figure \@ref(fig:out-of-order-3)).

```{r out-of-order-1, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Code that was written out of order, but not yet executed.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/out-of-order-1.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x800")
```

```{r out-of-order-2, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Code that was written out of order, and was executed using the run button in a nonlinear error without error. The order of execution can be traced by following the numbers to the left of the code cells; their order indicates the order in which the cells were executed.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/out-of-order-2.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x800")
```


(ref:out-of-order-3) Code that was written out of order, and was executed in a linear order using "Restart Kernel and Run All Cells..." This resulted in an error at the execution of the second code cell and it failed to run all code cells in the notebook.

```{r out-of-order-3, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = '(ref:out-of-order-3)', fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/out-of-order-3.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x800")
```

You can also accidentally create a nonfunctioning notebook by
creating an object in a cell that later gets deleted. In such a 
scenario, that object only exists for that one particular R session and will 
not exist once the notebook is restarted and run again. If that 
object was referenced in another cell in that notebook, an error 
would occur when the notebook was run again in a new session.

These events may not negatively affect the current R session when 
the code is being written; but as you might now see, they will likely lead to 
errors when that notebook is run in a future session. Regularly executing 
the entire notebook in a fresh R session will help guard 
against this. If you restart your session and new errors seem to pop up when
you run all of your cells in linear order, you can at least be aware that there
is an issue. Knowing this sooner rather than later will allow you to 
fix the issue and ensure your notebook can be run linearly from start to finish.

We recommend as a best practice to run the entire notebook in a fresh R session
at least 2-3 times within any period of work. Note that,
critically, you *must do this in a fresh R session* by restarting your kernel.
We recommend using either the **Kernel** >> 
**Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...** command from the menu or the ▶▶ 
button in the toolbar. Note that the **Run** >> **Run All Cells** 
menu item will not restart the kernel, and so it is not sufficient 
to guard against these errors.

### Best practices for including R packages in notebooks

Most data analyses these days depend on functions from external R packages that 
are not built into R. One example is the `tidyverse` metapackage that we 
heavily rely on in this book. This package provides us access to functions like 
`read_csv` for reading data, `select` for subsetting columns, and `ggplot` for 
creating high-quality graphics. 

As mentioned earlier in the book, external R packages need to be loaded before 
the functions they contain can be used. Our recommended way to do this is via 
`library(package_name)`. But where should this line of code be written in a 
Jupyter notebook? One idea could be to load the library right before the 
function is used in the notebook. However, although this technically works, this 
causes hidden, or at least non-obvious, R package dependencies when others view 
or try to run the notebook. These hidden dependencies can lead to errors when 
the notebook is executed on another computer if the needed R packages are not 
installed. Additionally, if the data analysis code takes a long time to run, 
uncovering the hidden dependencies that need to be installed so that the 
analysis can run without error can take a great deal of time to uncover.

Therefore, we recommend you load all R packages in a code cell near the top of 
the Jupyter notebook. Loading all your packages at the start ensures that all 
packages are loaded before their functions are called, assuming the notebook is 
run in a linear order from top to bottom as recommended above. It also makes it 
easy for others viewing or running the notebook to see what external R packages 
are used in the analysis, and hence, what packages they should install on 
their computer to run the analysis successfully.

### Summary of best practices for running a notebook

1. Write code so that it can be executed in a linear order.

2. As you write code in a Jupyter notebook, run the notebook in a linear order 
and in its entirety often (2-3 times every work session) via the **Kernel** >> 
**Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...** command from the Jupyter menu or the ▶▶ 
button in the toolbar.

3. Write the code that loads external R packages near the top of the Jupyter 
notebook.

## Exploring data files

It is essential to preview data files before you try to read them into R to see
whether or not there are column names, what the delimiters are, and if there are 
lines you need to skip. In Jupyter, you preview data files stored as plain text 
files (e.g., comma- and tab-separated files) in their plain text format (Figure \@ref(fig:open-data-w-editor-2)) by 
right-clicking on the file's name in the Jupyter file explorer, selecting 
**Open with**, and then selecting **Editor** (Figure \@ref(fig:open-data-w-editor-1)). 
Suppose you do not specify to open 
the data file with an editor. In that case, Jupyter will render a nice table 
for you, and you will not be able to see the column delimiters, and therefore 
you will not know which function to use, nor which arguments to use and values 
to specify for them.

```{r open-data-w-editor-1, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Opening data files with an editor in Jupyter.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/open_data_w_editor_01.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x2000")
```

```{r open-data-w-editor-2, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "A data file as viewed in an editor in Jupyter.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/open_data_w_editor_02.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x2000")
```

## Exporting to a different file format 

In Jupyter, viewing, editing and running R code is done in the Jupyter notebook 
file format with \index{Jupyter notebook!export} file extension `.ipynb`. This file format is not easy to open and 
view outside of Jupyter. Thus, to share your analysis with people who do not 
commonly use Jupyter, it is recommended that you export your executed analysis 
as a more common file type, such as an `.html` file, or a `.pdf`. We recommend 
exporting the Jupyter notebook after executing the analysis so that you can 
also share the outputs of your code. Note, however, that your audience will not be
able to *run* your analysis using a `.html` or `.pdf` file. If you want your audience
to be able to reproduce the analysis, you must provide them with the `.ipynb` Jupyter notebook file.

### Exporting to HTML
Exporting to `.html` will result in a shareable file that anyone can open 
using a web browser (e.g., Firefox, Safari, Chrome, or Edge). The `.html`
output will produce a document that is visually similar to what the Jupyter notebook 
looked like inside Jupyter. One point of caution here is that if there are 
images in your Jupyter notebook, you will need to share the image files and the 
`.html` file to see them.

### Exporting to PDF
Exporting to `.pdf` will result in a shareable file that anyone can open 
using many programs, including Adobe Acrobat, Preview, web browsers and many 
more. The benefit of exporting to PDF is that it is a standalone document, 
even if the Jupyter notebook included references to image files. 
Unfortunately, the default settings will result in a document 
that visually looks quite different from what the Jupyter notebook looked 
like. The font, page margins, and other details will appear different in the `.pdf` output. 

## Creating a new Jupyter notebook

At some point, you will want to create a new, fresh Jupyter notebook for your 
own project instead of viewing, running or editing a notebook that was started 
by someone else. To do this, navigate to the **Launcher** tab, and click on 
the R icon under the **Notebook** heading. If no **Launcher** tab is visible, 
you can get a new one via clicking the **+** button at the top of the Jupyter 
file explorer (Figure \@ref(fig:launcher)). 

```{r launcher, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Clicking on the R icon under the Notebook heading will create a new Jupyter notebook with an R kernel.", fig.retina = 2, out.width="100%"}
image_read("img/launcher-annotated.png") |> 
  image_crop("3632x2000")
```


Once you have created a new Jupyter notebook, be sure to give it a descriptive 
name, as the default file name is `Untitled.ipynb`. You can rename files by 
right-clicking on the file name of the Jupyter notebook you just created and 
click **Rename**. This will make the file name editable. Use your keyboard to 
change the name. Pressing `Enter` or clicking anywhere else in the Jupyter 
interface will save the changed file name.

We recommend not using white space or non-standard characters in file names. 
Doing so will not prevent you from using that file in Jupyter. However, these 
sorts of things become troublesome as you start to do more advanced data 
science projects that involve repetition and automation. We recommend naming 
files using lower case characters and separating words by a dash (`-`) or an 
underscore (`_`).
