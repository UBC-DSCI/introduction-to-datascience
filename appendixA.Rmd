# Download files from a JupyterHub for later local use {#appendixA}

This section will help you
save your work from the JupyterHub web-based platform to your own computer. 

First, in JupyterHub, open a terminal by clicking "terminal" in the Launcher tab. 
Next, type the following in the terminal to create a 
compressed `.zip` archive for the work you are interested in downloading:

```
zip -r hub_folder.zip your_folder
```

After the compressing process is complete, right-click on `hub_folder.zip`
in the JupyterHub file browser
and click "Download". You should be able to use your computer's software to unzip
the compressed folder by double-clicking on it.
