<!-- NOTE: do not edit the "title:" entry in the top YAML, or the "Welcome!" line below the top YAML without *also* editing
the build_pdf.sh script. The build_pdf.sh script builds the PDF version of the book, which does not include the cover image 
or the welcome text. However, it doesn't seem possible with bookdown to handle these two differences between HTML
and PDF easily. So the "build_pdf.sh" script uses 'sed' to remove these two things first from this index.Rmd file 
before compiling. If you edit the title/Welcome! lines, those 'sed' commands probably won't work any more.-->
